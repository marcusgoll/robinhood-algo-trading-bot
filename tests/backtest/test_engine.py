        Test: BacktestEngine processes bars in chronological order without look-ahead bias.

        **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1. Strategy processes bars in exact chronological order (bar[0] â†’ bar[9])
        2. At bar[i], strategy can only see bars[0:i+1], not future bars[i+1:]
        3. Number of calls to should_enter() equals number of bars (10)
        4. Each call has progressively more visible data (1 bar, then 2, then 3, etc.)
        5. No future bar timestamps are visible when processing current bar

        - When processing bar at index i=5 (timestamp 2024-01-07):
