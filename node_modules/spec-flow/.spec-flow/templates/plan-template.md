**Scale**: [10k users, 1M records, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

> **REMOVE THIS SECTION IF**: No project constitution file exists at `.spec-flow/memory/constitution.md`

**Project Constitution Principles** (from `.spec-flow/memory/constitution.md`):
- [ ] [Principle I]: [Description]
- [ ] [Principle II]: [Description]
- [ ] [Principle III]: [Description]
- [ ] [Principle IV]: [Description]
- [ ] [Principle V]: [Description]
- [ ] [Principle VI]: [Description]
- [ ] [Principle VII]: [Description]
- [ ] [Principle VIII]: [Description]

*Replace with actual principles from your project's constitution file, or remove this section entirely if no constitution exists*

## Project Structure

**Documentation** (`specs/[###-feature]/`):
- `plan.md` - This file
- `research.md` - Phase 0 output
- `data-model.md` - Phase 1 output
- `quickstart.md` - Phase 1 output
- `error-log.md` - Failure tracking
- `contracts/` - Phase 1 output
- `tasks.md` - Phase 2 output (from /tasks command)

**Source Code** (repository root):

```
# Option 1: Single project (DEFAULT)
src/, tests/

# Option 2: Web application (frontend + backend detected)
backend/src/, frontend/src/

# Option 3: Mobile + API (iOS/Android detected)
api/, ios/ or android/
```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile]

## Context Engineering Plan

- **Context budget**: [Max tokens, tool output trims, when to compact]
- **Token triage**: [What stays resident vs. retrieved on demand]
- **Retrieval strategy**: [JIT tools, identifiers, caching heuristics]
- **Memory artifacts**: [NOTES.md / TODO.md cadence, retention policy]
- **Compaction & resets**: [Summaries, tool log pruning, restart triggers]
- **Sub-agent handoffs**: [Scopes, shared state, summary contract]

## Phase 0: Codebase Scan & Research

### [EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE - REUSE]

From codebase scan:
- âœ… [ExistingService] ([path])
- âœ… [ExistingMiddleware] ([path])
- âœ… Similar pattern: [path] (follow this structure)

### [NEW INFRASTRUCTURE - CREATE]

No existing alternatives:
- ðŸ†• [NewService] (new capability)
- ðŸ†• [NewIntegration] (new integration)

### Research Findings

Decision: [what was chosen]
Rationale: [why chosen]
Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]
Existing code to reuse: [from codebase scan]

**Output**: research.md with [EXISTING/NEW] sections and all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### [ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS]

- Stack choices with rationale (from research.md)
- Communication patterns (REST/GraphQL/WebSocket)
- State management approach
- Why reusing X instead of creating Y

### [STRUCTURE]

- Directory layout (follow existing patterns from scan)
- Module organization
- File naming conventions

### [SCHEMA]

> **REMOVE THIS SECTION IF**: No database changes needed (pure UI feature, config-only change)

- Database tables with relationships (Mermaid ERD)
- Migrations needed
- Index strategy
- RLS policies (if applicable)

### [PERFORMANCE TARGETS]

- API: <500ms p95 response time
- Frontend: <1.5s FCP, <3s TTI
- Database: <100ms query time
- Bundle size: <200KB initial

### [SECURITY]

> **REMOVE THIS SECTION IF**: No security-sensitive changes (internal tool, read-only feature, cosmetic UI)

- Authentication strategy (JWT/Clerk/OAuth)
- Authorization model (RBAC/ABAC)
- Input validation approach
- Rate limiting rules
- Data encryption (at rest/in transit)

### Artifacts Generated

1. **data-model.md**: Entities, fields (referencing REUSE from existing models), relationships, validation rules
2. **contracts/**: OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas for each endpoint
3. **Contract tests**: One test file per endpoint, must fail initially
4. **quickstart.md**: Integration test scenarios from user stories
5. **Agent context**: Updated incrementally with NEW tech only

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, [EXISTING/NEW] in plan.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `\spec-flow/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs
- Each contract â†’ contract test task [P]
- Each entity â†’ model creation task [P]
- Each user story â†’ integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

## Complexity Tracking

> **REMOVE THIS SECTION IF**: No constitution violations or complexity exceptions needed

**Purpose**: Document and justify any deviations from project constitution or KISS principle.

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected |
|-----------|------------|------------------------------|
| [Principle violated] | [Specific business need] | [Why simpler approach insufficient] |
| [e.g., "No file storage"] | [e.g., "User-uploaded PDFs for 7-day preview"] | [e.g., "In-memory only insufficient for multi-device access"] |

*Only include this section if you need to justify complexity that violates constitution principles*
