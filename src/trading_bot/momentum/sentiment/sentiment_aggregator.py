"""Sentiment score aggregation with recency weighting.

Aggregates sentiment scores from multiple posts using a 30-minute rolling
window with exponential decay weighting (recent posts weighted more heavily).

Constitution v1.0.0:
- Safety_First: Minimum 10 posts required for reliable signal
- Risk_Management: Exponential decay prevents stale data
- Security: Input validation on score ranges

Feature: sentiment-analysis-integration
Tasks: T023-T024 [GREEN] - SentimentAggregator implementation

    Features:
    - 30-minute rolling window aggregation
