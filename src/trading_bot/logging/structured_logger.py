Structured Trade Logger

Thread-safe JSONL-based trade logging with daily file rotation.

Constitution v1.0.0:
- §Audit_Everything: All trades logged to immutable JSONL files
- §Data_Integrity: Atomic writes with file locking prevent corruption
- §Safety_First: Thread-safe concurrent write handling

Feature: trade-logging

    Features:
    - Daily JSONL files (logs/trades/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl)
    - Thread-safe concurrent writes (file locking)
    - Optimized buffering for <5ms write latency (NFR-003)
    - Append-only mode (no overwriting)

    Example:
        >>> logger = StructuredTradeLogger(log_dir=Path("logs"))

        Creates a thread-safe logger instance for writing trade records to daily
        JSONL files. The logger automatically handles directory creation, file
        rotation, and concurrent write coordination per Constitution v1.0.0
        §Audit_Everything and §Data_Integrity.

        Args:
            log_dir: Directory for trade log files (default: ./logs).
                Daily JSONL files will be created directly in this directory
                with naming pattern: YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl (e.g., "2025-01-09.jsonl").
                Directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist.

        Examples:
            Default logs directory:
            >>> logger = StructuredTradeLogger()
            >>> # Logs to: logs/2025-01-09.jsonl

        Notes:
            - Thread-safe: Multiple bot instances can share same logger
            - Auto-rotation: New file created daily at midnight UTC
            - Directory creation: Parent directories created automatically

        Thread-safe operation per Constitution v1.0.0 §Data_Integrity and §Safety_First.
        Implements append-only immutable audit trail with graceful error handling.

        Performance: <5ms write latency (NFR-003) via 8KB buffering
        Concurrency: File locking prevents data corruption from multiple writers
        Reliability: Graceful degradation on errors (bot continues operating)

        Thread-safe operation with the following guarantees:
        - Atomic writes: File locking prevents corruption during concurrent writes
        - Append-only: Existing records never overwritten (immutable audit trail)
        - Fast writes: <5ms average latency via 8KB buffering (NFR-003)
        - Auto-creation: Directory and file created automatically
        - Graceful degradation: Errors logged to stderr, bot continues

        Args:
            record: TradeRecord instance to log. Must pass validation
                (__post_init__ checks) before calling this method.

        Raises:
            None: All errors caught and logged to stderr. Bot continues
                operating even if trade logging fails (graceful degradation).

        Error Handling:
            - Disk full (OSError): Logged to stderr, trade execution continues
            - Permission denied (OSError): Logged to stderr, trade execution continues
            - Directory creation failure: Logged to stderr, trade execution continues
            - All errors visible in stderr output for audit trail

        Examples:
            Basic trade logging:
            >>> from decimal import Decimal
            >>> logger = StructuredTradeLogger()

            >>> logger.log_trade(trade)
            >>> # Trade written to: logs/2025-01-09.jsonl

            ...     executor.map(logger.log_trade, trades)
            >>> # All trades logged without corruption

        Performance:
            - Typical latency: 0.4ms (T021 benchmark: 0.405ms average)
            - Throughput: ~2,467 writes/second (T021 benchmark)
