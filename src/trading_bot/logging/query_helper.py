        queries on arbitrarily large log files without memory constraints. Critical
        for performance at scale (NFR-005: <500ms for 1000 trades).

        Implementation: Reads file line-by-line, parsing each JSON object into
        TradeRecord. Decimal fields automatically converted from strings back to
        Decimal objects for precision. Malformed lines skipped gracefully.

        Args:
            file_path: Path to JSONL file (format: YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl).

        Yields:
            TradeRecord: Parsed trade record from each valid JSONL line.
                String prices converted back to Decimal for calculations.

        Error Handling:
            - Missing file: Yields nothing, no exception raised
            - Empty lines: Skipped automatically
            - Malformed JSON: Line skipped, logged to continue (defensive)
