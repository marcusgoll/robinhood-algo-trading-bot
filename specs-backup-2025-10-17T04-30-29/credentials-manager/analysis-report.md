## TDD Task Ordering Analysis

**RED Phase Tasks** (16): T004-T014, T024-T027, T029
- All RED tasks write failing tests before implementation
- Tests cover all functional requirements
- Integration tests included (T024-T027)
- Performance tests included (T029)

**GREEN Phase Tasks** (8): T015-T020, T028, T030
- Each GREEN task references corresponding RED tasks via [GREEN->TXXX] notation
- Implementation tasks properly follow test tasks
- Integration test fixes included (T028)

**REFACTOR Phase Tasks** (3): T021-T023
- Extract masking utilities (T021)
- Clean up validation logic (T022)
- Add type hints (T023)

**Ordering Validation**: Valid
- RED tasks come before GREEN tasks for same behavior
- REFACTOR tasks come after GREEN tasks
- No ordering violations detected

- Token persistence methods - Implemented by T018, T019

**Alignment**: All planned components have corresponding tasks

---

## Security Validation

**Credential Masking** (FR-007):
- Username masking: T004, T015 (first 3 chars + ***)
- Password masking: T005, T015 (*****)
- MFA secret masking: T006, T015 (****)
- Device token masking: T007, T015 (first 8 chars + ***)
- Log verification: T027 (integration test)

**Validation** (FR-008, FR-009):
- MFA format validation: T008-T010, T016 (16-char base32 regex)
- Device token validation: T011, T017 (optional field)
- Startup blocking: T016, T017 (raise ValidationError)

**Audit Trail** (NFR-004):
- All auth operations logged with masked credentials (T015, T021)
- Structured log events for measurement (spec.md Measurement Plan)

**Status**: All security requirements have test coverage

---

## Performance Analysis

**Targets** (from spec.md):
- Credential validation: <500ms (NFR-002)
- MFA format validation: <10ms (plan.md)
- Device token validation: <5ms (plan.md)
- .env file update: <50ms (plan.md)
- Full auth flow: <5s (HEART metrics)

**Test Coverage**:
- T029: Validates validation completes in <500ms
- T030: Optimization task to meet performance target

**Measurement Plan**:
- Performance metrics defined in spec.md HEART framework
- Auth duration logged in structured events
- Measurement queries provided for bash analysis

**Status**: Performance requirements covered with tests

## Integration Scenario Coverage

**From plan.md [INTEGRATION SCENARIOS]**:

| Scenario | Description | Task Coverage |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Scenario 1 | First-time setup | T024 (integration test) |
| Scenario 2 | Validation checks | T008-T011, T016, T017, T029 |
| Scenario 3 | Subsequent runs (device token reuse) | T025 (integration test) |
| Scenario 4 | MFA fallback | T026 (integration test) |
| Scenario 5 | Credential masking verification | T027 (integration test) |

**Status**: All 5 integration scenarios have corresponding tests

## Recommendations

### Code Quality
- All tasks include clear acceptance criteria
- TDD ordering properly enforced (RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR)
- Performance targets are measurable with tests (T029)
- Security requirements have comprehensive test coverage

### Implementation Approach
1. Start with Phase 3.1 (Setup): T001-T003
2. Execute RED phase: T004-T014 (write all failing tests)
3. Execute GREEN phase: T015-T020 (implement to pass tests)
4. Execute REFACTOR phase: T021-T023 (clean up)
5. Integration testing: T024-T028
6. Error handling: T029-T031
7. Documentation: T032-T034

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests cover all masking, validation, and auth logic
- Integration tests cover all 5 user scenarios from spec.md
- Performance test ensures <500ms validation (NFR-002)
- Log masking verified in integration test (T027)

## Next Steps

**Ready for Implementation**

Next: `/implement credentials-manager`

/implement will:
1. Read tasks.md (execute 34 tasks)
2. Follow TDD (RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR)
3. Reference plan.md for architecture decisions
4. Commit after each task
5. Update error-log.md (track issues)

Estimated duration: 6-8 hours (per tasks.md summary)
