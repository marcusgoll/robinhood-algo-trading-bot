# Production Readiness Report
**Date**: 2025-10-10 10:05:00  
**Feature**: status-dashboard  
**Project Type**: local-only (CLI tool)

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **READY FOR MANUAL TESTING**  
⏳ **PRODUCTION BLOCKER**: Pending performance & integration validation

Key improvements this iteration:
- Replaced the `pynput` dependency with a portable stdin command reader and structured usage logging.
- Centralised state aggregation in `DashboardDataProvider`, enabling reuse by the forthcoming Textual TUI.
- Completed export handling, warning surfacing, and command processing (R/E/H/Q) end-to-end.
- Added a dedicated dashboard test suite (19 unit cases) and captured coverage via a new `dashboard.coveragerc`; dashboard code now sits at **97 % coverage**.

Use the following to reproduce verification locally:

```bash
uv run coverage run --rcfile=dashboard.coveragerc -m pytest tests/unit/test_dashboard/test_dashboard_orchestration.py
uv run coverage report --rcfile=dashboard.coveragerc
```

## Performance

| Metric | Target | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Dashboard startup | <2 s | ⏳ Pending | Measure during manual run (T036) |
| Refresh cycle | <500 ms | ⏳ Pending | Requires live data benchmark (T037) |
| Export generation | <1 s | ⏳ Pending | Validate while running manual tests (T038) |
| Memory footprint | <50 MB | ⏳ Pending | Observe via `ps`/`top` during manual session |

**Assessment**: Benchmarks are the remaining gating factor; execute Tasks T036–T038 during acceptance.

---

## Security

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Critical vulnerabilities | ✅ PASS | 0 high/critical findings |
| YAML parsing | ✅ PASS | `yaml.safe_load`; no code execution |
| Input validation | ✅ PASS | Command reader normalises and filters input |
| PII exposure | ✅ PASS | No credentials or account numbers emitted |
| Auth/authz | ✅ PASS | Reuses authenticated AccountData & TradeQueryHelper |
| Rate limiting | ✅ PASS | Respects AccountData 60 s cache window |

**Assessment**: No new risks introduced; safe to proceed.

---

## Accessibility

CLI-only feature – **N/A** (keyboard navigation and screen-reader support delegated to terminal emulator).

---

## Code Quality

### Senior Code Review
- Initial blocking issues (imports, lint) were auto-fixed.
- Latest changes reviewed; no new critical items raised.

### Quality Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Type coverage | 100 % | 100 % | ✅ PASS |
| Lint compliance | 100 % | 100 % | ✅ PASS |
| Dashboard module coverage | 90 % | 97 % | ✅ PASS |
| Unit tests | 100 % | 19/19 passing | ✅ PASS |

Detail (`dashboard.coveragerc`):
- `dashboard.py` 98 %
- `data_provider.py` 95 %
- `display_renderer.py` 94 %
- `export_generator.py` 99 %
- `metrics_calculator.py` 95 %
- `models.py` 100 %

## Blockers & Follow-ups

### Important (Should Address Before Production)
1. **Performance Benchmarks Outstanding**  
   - Execute Tasks T036–T038 (startup, refresh, export timing, memory snapshot).

2. **Integration / Manual Acceptance**  
   - Complete Tasks T030–T035 & T042–T044 (integration tests, error drill, manual verification).

### Minor (Optional Enhancements)
- Modernise remaining datetime usage to `datetime.UTC`.
- Persist session count metrics if required by roadmap.
- Explore Textual TUI implementation using the new snapshot provider.

---

## What’s Working Well
✅ Modular snapshot architecture shared across CLI and future TUI.  
✅ Comprehensive test coverage with realistic staleness/export scenarios.  
✅ Graceful degradation on missing targets/logs and keyboard interrupts.  
✅ Security posture unchanged; no secrets or credentials touched.  
✅ Documentation updated in plan/spec/tasks to reflect new abstractions.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Acceptance (T042)** – run the dashboard against live/paper data, capture benchmarks, verify warning/export flows.  
2. **Integration Checks (T030–T035)** – ensure orchestration with existing startup/auth flows.  
3. **Documentation & Validation (T039–T044)** – update NOTES/README with new controls, add acceptance evidence.  
4. **Optional polishing** – implement session tracking persistence, apply datetime modernisation, evaluate Textual UI.

---

## Recommendation

- **Manual testing**: ✅ Approved. Launch via `python -m trading_bot dashboard`, follow acceptance checklist.  
- **Production rollout**: ⏳ Conditional – unblock once performance & integration tasks complete.

Estimated remaining effort to production-ready: **~6–8 hours** (benchmarks + integration validation + docs).

**Phase**: 5 (Optimization)  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for manual acceptance; production gated on benchmarks/integration.
