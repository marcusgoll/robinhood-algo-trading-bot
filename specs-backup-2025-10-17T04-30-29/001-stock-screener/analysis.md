## Constitution Alignment

### ✅ All Principles Addressed

| Principle | Coverage | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| §Safety_First | ✅ Complete | Screener is read-only (no trades); paper-trading compatible (FR-001); graceful error handling (FR-008, NFR-005) |
| §Code_Quality | ✅ Complete | 100% type hints required (data-model.md, plan.md); KISS principle (simple filters); DRY via MarketDataService reuse |
| §Risk_Management | ✅ Complete | Passive tool (identifies candidates only); no position sizing by screener; traders apply own risk rules |
| §Testing_Requirements | ✅ Complete | 90%+ coverage target (NFR-007, tasks.md T024-T025); unit + integration tests; TDD approach (25% of tasks are tests) |
| §Audit_Everything | ✅ Complete | All queries logged to JSONL (NFR-008, tasks.md T023); timestamps, params, results, latency, errors tracked |
| §Error_Handling | ✅ Complete | @with_retry integration (NFR-002, plan.md); graceful missing data (FR-008, data-model.md); detailed error logging |
| §Security | ✅ Complete | No new credentials (uses existing env vars); API key handling inherited from MarketDataService; input validation (FR-002, FR-011) |
| §Data_Integrity | ✅ Complete | Market data validation (NFR-004); handle missing data (spec.md edge case #3); UTC timestamps (data-model.md) |

**Verdict**: ✅ **CONSTITUTION COMPLIANT** - All 8 MUST principles explicitly addressed
