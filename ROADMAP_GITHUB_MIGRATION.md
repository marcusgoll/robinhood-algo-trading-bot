## Workflow Integration

### Starting a New Feature
1. Find issue in backlog: `gh issue list --label status:backlog`
2. Move to in-progress: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label status:in-progress --remove-label status:backlog`
3. Create spec: `/spec <slug>` (using slug from issue)
4. Link PR: Reference issue number in PR description

### Shipping a Feature
