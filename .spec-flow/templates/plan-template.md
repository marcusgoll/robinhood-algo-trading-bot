# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Date**: [DATE]
**Spec**: [link]

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, TypeScript 5.0 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, Next.js, PostgreSQL or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Storage**: [e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis, files or N/A]
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, Jest, Playwright or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, Browser, Mobile or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines structure]
**Performance**: [<10s extraction, <500ms API, <1.5s FCP or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Constraints**: [<200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Scale**: [10k users, 1M records, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

**CFIpros Core Principles**:
- [ ] I. Extractor-First: <10s extraction results
- [ ] II. Hybrid Extraction: Regex + Vision LLM appropriately
- [ ] III. Minimal Data: No file storage post-extraction
- [ ] IV. Transparent Mapping: ACS DB authoritative source
- [ ] V. Tiered Visibility: Free/paid separation enforced
- [ ] VI. Rolling Stats: Privacy-preserving aggregation
- [ ] VII. Accuracy Loop: Correction mechanism included
- [ ] VIII. No Overengineering: Simple MVP approach
- [ ] IX. Code Quality: Type safety, linting, DRY
- [ ] X. Testing: 80% coverage, integration planned
- [ ] XI. UX Consistency: Design system, accessibility
- [ ] XII. Performance: <10s P95, <500ms API thresholds

## Project Structure

**Documentation** (`specs/[###-feature]/`):
- `plan.md` - This file
- `research.md` - Phase 0 output
- `data-model.md` - Phase 1 output
- `quickstart.md` - Phase 1 output
- `error-log.md` - Failure tracking
- `contracts/` - Phase 1 output
- `tasks.md` - Phase 2 output (from /tasks command)

**Source Code** (repository root):

```
# Option 1: Single project (DEFAULT)
src/, tests/

# Option 2: Web application (frontend + backend detected)
backend/src/, frontend/src/

# Option 3: Mobile + API (iOS/Android detected)
api/, ios/ or android/
```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile]

## Context Engineering Plan

- **Context budget**: [Max tokens, tool output trims, when to compact]
- **Token triage**: [What stays resident vs. retrieved on demand]
- **Retrieval strategy**: [JIT tools, identifiers, caching heuristics]
- **Memory artifacts**: [NOTES.md / TODO.md cadence, retention policy]
- **Compaction & resets**: [Summaries, tool log pruning, restart triggers]
- **Sub-agent handoffs**: [Scopes, shared state, summary contract]

## Phase 0: Codebase Scan & Research

### [EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE - REUSE]

From codebase scan:
- âœ… [ExistingService] ([path])
- âœ… [ExistingMiddleware] ([path])
- âœ… Similar pattern: [path] (follow this structure)

### [NEW INFRASTRUCTURE - CREATE]

No existing alternatives:
- ðŸ†• [NewService] (new capability)
- ðŸ†• [NewIntegration] (new integration)

### Research Findings

Decision: [what was chosen]
Rationale: [why chosen]
Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]
Existing code to reuse: [from codebase scan]

**Output**: research.md with [EXISTING/NEW] sections and all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### [ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS]

- Stack choices with rationale (from research.md)
- Communication patterns (REST/GraphQL/WebSocket)
- State management approach
- Why reusing X instead of creating Y

### [STRUCTURE]

- Directory layout (follow existing patterns from scan)
- Module organization
- File naming conventions

### [SCHEMA]

- Database tables with relationships (Mermaid ERD)
- Migrations needed
- Index strategy

### [PERFORMANCE TARGETS]

- API: <500ms p95 response time
- Frontend: <1.5s FCP, <3s TTI
- Database: <100ms query time
- Bundle size: <200KB initial

### [SECURITY]

- Authentication strategy (JWT/Clerk/OAuth)
- Authorization model (RBAC/ABAC)
- Input validation approach
- Rate limiting rules

### Artifacts Generated

1. **data-model.md**: Entities, fields (referencing REUSE from existing models), relationships, validation rules
2. **contracts/**: OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas for each endpoint
3. **Contract tests**: One test file per endpoint, must fail initially
4. **quickstart.md**: Integration test scenarios from user stories
5. **Agent context**: Updated incrementally with NEW tech only

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, [EXISTING/NEW] in plan.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `\spec-flow/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs
- Each contract â†’ contract test task [P]
- Each entity â†’ model creation task [P]
- Each user story â†’ integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected |
|-----------|------------|------------------------------|
| [Only if constitutional violations exist] | [specific need] | [why simpler approach insufficient] |

## Progress Tracking

**Phase Gates**:
