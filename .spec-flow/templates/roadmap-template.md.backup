## Scoring Guide

**ICE Score** = Impact × Confidence ÷ Effort

- **Impact** (1-5): User value
  - 1 = Nice-to-have polish
  - 3 = Useful improvement
  - 5 = Critical for user success
- **Effort** (1-5): Implementation complexity
  - 1 = Trivial (< 1 day)
  - 3 = Medium (1-2 weeks)
  - 5 = Epic (4+ weeks)
- **Confidence** (0-1): Estimate certainty
  - 0.5 = Very uncertain
  - 0.7 = Some unknowns
  - 0.9 = High confidence
  - 1.0 = Certain

Higher score = higher priority

## Status Flow

```
Backlog → Later → Next → In Progress → Shipped
                               ↓
                          Archive (if deprecated)
```

## Feature Sizing

Keep features **\spec-flow-sized**:
- ≤ 30 implementation tasks
- One screen/flow/API surface
- 1-2 weeks implementation time

If larger: Break into multiple features by area (marketing/app/api) or domain.
