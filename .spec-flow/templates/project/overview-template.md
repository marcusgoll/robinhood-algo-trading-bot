# Project Overview

**Last Updated**: [DATE]
**Status**: [Draft | Active | Archived]

## Vision Statement

[One paragraph: What is this project, why does it exist, what problem does it solve?]

**Example**: FlightPro is a SaaS platform that helps certified flight instructors (CFIs) manage their students, track progress, and maintain compliance with FAA regulations. We exist because current solutions are either too expensive ($200+/mo) or lack critical features like ACS-mapped progress tracking. Our goal is to provide an affordable (<$50/mo), comprehensive tool that helps CFIs run their business efficiently.

## Target Users

### Primary Persona: [Name]

**Who**: [Role, experience level, context]

**Example**: Sarah Chen, CFI with 3-5 years experience, managing 10-15 students simultaneously

**Goals**:
- [Goal 1]
- [Goal 2]
- [Goal 3]

**Example Goals**:
- Track each student's progress against ACS standards
- Identify weak areas requiring additional practice
- Minimize administrative time (currently 5+ hours/week)

**Pain Points**:
- [Pain 1]
- [Pain 2]

**Example Pains**:
- Manual tracking in spreadsheets is error-prone
- No easy way to visualize student progress over time
- Compliance reporting takes hours before checkrides

### Secondary Persona: [Name]

[Repeat structure above for 2-3 personas max]

## Core Value Proposition

**For** [target user]
**Who** [user need/problem]
**The** [project name]
**Is a** [product category]
**That** [key benefit]
**Unlike** [competitors]
**Our product** [primary differentiator]

**Example**:
**For** certified flight instructors
**Who** need to track student progress and maintain FAA compliance
**The** FlightPro platform
**Is a** student management system
**That** maps lessons directly to ACS standards and automates compliance reporting
**Unlike** ForeFlight or FlyingCloud which cost $200+/mo
**Our product** provides the same core features at 1/4 the price with better ACS integration

## Success Metrics

**Business KPIs** (how we measure project success):

| Metric | Target | Timeframe | Measurement Source |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| [Metric 1] | [Target] | [When] | [Where to check] |
| [Metric 2] | [Target] | [When] | [Where to check] |

**Example**:

| Metric | Target | Timeframe | Measurement Source |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Active subscriptions | 100 | 6 months | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM subscriptions WHERE status='active'` |
| Monthly recurring revenue | $2,500 | 6 months | Stripe dashboard |
| User retention (30-day) | >80% | 3 months | `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM sessions WHERE created_at BETWEEN...` |
| NPS score | >40 | 6 months | In-app survey (PostHog) |

## Scope Boundaries

### In Scope (what we ARE building)

- [Feature category 1]
- [Feature category 2]
- [Feature category 3]

**Example**:
- Student progress tracking (ACS-mapped)
- Lesson planning and scheduling
- Automated compliance reporting
- Mobile-friendly instructor dashboard
- Basic billing/invoicing

### Out of Scope (what we are NOT building)

- [Explicitly excluded 1] - **Why**: [rationale]
- [Explicitly excluded 2] - **Why**: [rationale]

**Example**:
- Student-facing mobile app - **Why**: MVP focuses on instructor workflow, students use web
- Advanced analytics/BI dashboards - **Why**: Low ROI for v1.0, defer to v2.0
- Multi-school enterprise features - **Why**: Target is individual CFIs, not flight schools (yet)
- Integration with scheduling tools (Calendly) - **Why**: Manual scheduling adequate for MVP

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

| Product | Strengths | Weaknesses | Price | Market Position |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------|----------------|
| [Competitor 1] | [Strengths] | [Weaknesses] | [Price] | [Position] |

**Example**:

| Product | Strengths | Weaknesses | Price | Market Position |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------|----------------|
| ForeFlight | Industry standard, comprehensive features, excellent UX | Expensive, overkill for small CFIs | $200/mo | Market leader, 70% market share |
| FlyingCloud | Good ACS mapping, mobile app | Poor UX, frequent bugs, slow support | $150/mo | Growing, 15% market share |
| MyFlightTraining | Affordable | No ACS mapping, basic features only | $50/mo | Niche, 5% market share |

### Our Positioning

**Positioning Statement**: [How we differentiate and where we fit in market]

**Example**: "FlightPro targets cost-conscious individual CFIs who need ACS-mapped tracking without paying enterprise prices. We're the 'good enough' middle ground between expensive leaders (ForeFlight) and bare-bones budget options (MyFlightTraining)."

**Competitive Advantages**:
1. [Advantage 1]
2. [Advantage 2]

**Example**:
1. **Price**: 75% cheaper than ForeFlight while maintaining core features
2. **ACS Integration**: Better ACS mapping than MyFlightTraining
3. **Simplicity**: Faster onboarding than FlyingCloud (< 30 min vs 3+ hours)

## Assumptions

**Critical assumptions** (if wrong, project strategy changes):

1. [Assumption 1] - **Validation**: [How to validate]
2. [Assumption 2] - **Validation**: [How to validate]

**Example**:
1. CFIs will pay $25-50/mo for this tool - **Validation**: Landing page conversion rate >5%
2. ACS mapping is key differentiator - **Validation**: User interviews (8/10 CFIs cite this as top need)
3. Individual CFIs are better target than flight schools - **Validation**: Customer discovery (45 interviews)

**Example**:

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| ForeFlight drops price to $50/mo | High | Low | Focus on superior ACS mapping, simpler UX |
| FAA changes ACS standards significantly | Medium | Medium | Modular ACS data (easy to update), notify users |
| Low conversion from free trial | High | Medium | Improve onboarding, add video tutorials, reduce friction |
| Stripe payment integration issues | High | Low | Thorough testing, fallback to manual invoicing |
