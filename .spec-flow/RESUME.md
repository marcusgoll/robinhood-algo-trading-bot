# Resume Implementation: status-dashboard

**Created**: 2025-10-09 20:00 UTC
**Feature**: status-dashboard (CLI Status Dashboard & Performance Metrics)
**Current Phase**: 4 (Implementation) - Ready to start
**Project Type**: local-only

---

## Quick Resume

**In a new Claude Code session, run:**

```bash
/spec-flow continue
```

This will automatically:
1. Load workflow state from `.spec-flow/workflow-state.json`
2. Resume at Phase 4 (Implementation)
3. Execute remaining 44 tasks using parallel agents
4. Continue to Phase 5 (Optimization) when complete

## Progress Summary

### ✅ Completed Phases (0-3)

**Phase 0: Specification**
- 6 user scenarios for CLI dashboard
- 24 requirements (16 functional, 8 non-functional)
- Real-time monitoring with 5-second refresh
- Keyboard controls (R=refresh, E=export, Q=quit, H=help)
- Export to JSON + Markdown with target comparisons
- Hypothesis: 96% time reduction (3-5 min → <10s assessment)

**Phase 1: Planning**
- Architecture using `rich` library (v13.8.0, already installed)
- 5 reusable components:
  - AccountData service (60s TTL cache)
  - TradeQueryHelper (<15ms JSONL queries)
  - TradeRecord dataclass
  - time_utils (pytz timezone handling)
  - Structured logging pattern
- 4 new modules to create:
  - dashboard.py (orchestrator)
  - display_renderer.py (Rich UI rendering)
  - metrics_calculator.py (performance aggregation)
  - export_generator.py (JSON + Markdown)

**Phase 2: Task Breakdown**
- 44 tasks total
- TDD breakdown: 13 RED tests, 10 GREEN implementations, 3 REFACTOR cleanups
- 19 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
- Additional: 3 setup, 3 integration, 3 performance, 3 documentation, 3 validation
- Test coverage target: ≥90%
- Performance targets: <2s startup, <500ms refresh, <1s export

**Phase 3: Analysis**
- 100% requirement coverage (24/24 requirements mapped to tasks)
- 0 critical issues, 0 high-priority issues
- 2 medium issues (process improvements, non-blocking)
- 1 low issue (documentation clarity)
- Architecture validated: Separation of concerns, reuse strategy confirmed
- Security validated: Read-only dashboard, inherited auth
- Ready for implementation

## Pending: Phase 5 (Optimization)

After implementation complete:
- Performance validation
- Security audit (bandit scan)
- Senior code review
- Type coverage verification
- Lint compliance
- Auto-fix any issues
- Generate optimization report

---

## Pending: Phase 6+ (Deployment)

**Project Type**: local-only

No staging or production deployment needed. After optimization:
1. Merge to main branch
2. Feature ready for immediate use

---

## Key Files

**Workflow State:**
- `.spec-flow/workflow-state.json` (phase tracking)

**Specification Artifacts:**
- `specs/status-dashboard/spec.md` (24 requirements, 6 scenarios)
- `specs/status-dashboard/plan.md` (architecture, reuse analysis)
- `specs/status-dashboard/tasks.md` (44 concrete TDD tasks)
- `specs/status-dashboard/analysis-report.md` (100% coverage validation)
- `specs/status-dashboard/NOTES.md` (progress tracking)
- `specs/status-dashboard/error-log.md` (error tracking, empty so far)

**Configuration Examples:**
- `config/dashboard-targets.yaml.example` (created in T003)

---

## Implementation Strategy

The `/spec-flow continue` command will:

1. **Load State**: Read `.spec-flow/workflow-state.json`
2. **Detect Phase**: Current phase = 4 (Implementation)
3. **Execute /implement**: Call implement command directly
4. **Parallel Execution**: Group 44 tasks into batches
   - Batch tasks by domain (backend/frontend/tests/general)
   - Launch 3-5 parallel agents per batch
   - TDD phases (GREEN/REFACTOR) run sequentially
5. **Auto-commit**: Each task commits on success
6. **Progress Tracking**: Update NOTES.md after each task
7. **Continue to Phase 5**: Auto-proceed to /optimize when complete

---

## Expected Timeline

**Phase 4 (Implementation)**: 2-4 hours
- Setup: 5-10 minutes
- RED tests: 30-45 minutes
- GREEN implementation: 60-90 minutes
- REFACTOR: 15-30 minutes
- Integration: 30-45 minutes
- Documentation: 15-30 minutes
- Validation: 15-30 minutes

**Phase 5 (Optimization)**: 30-60 minutes
- Performance validation: 5-10 minutes
- Security audit: 5-10 minutes
- Code review: 10-20 minutes
- Type/lint checks: 5-10 minutes
- Report generation: 5-10 minutes

**Total**: 2.5-5 hours (with parallel execution: 2-3x faster = 1-2.5 hours actual)

---

## Resume Command

```bash
/spec-flow continue
```

That's it! The orchestrator will handle everything from here.

---

## Troubleshooting

**If workflow state is corrupted:**
```bash
# Manually set current phase in .spec-flow/workflow-state.json
# Change "current_phase": 4
```

**If tasks need manual execution:**
```bash
# Run /implement directly
/implement

# Then /optimize when complete
/optimize
```

**If you want to skip to optimization:**
```bash
# Mark all tasks complete in NOTES.md
# Then run
/optimize
```

---

**Ready to resume!** Just run `/spec-flow continue` in a new session.
