- JSONL append-only logging for alerts ✅
- JSON Schema validation for contract compliance ✅

- UTC timezone handling ✅
- Atomic file writes (temp + rename) ✅
- MD5 checksums for cache invalidation ✅

**Configuration**:
- YAML targets loaded from config/dashboard-targets.yaml ✅
- Environment variables for runtime config ✅
- Sensible defaults with override capability ✅

## Blockers

**None - ready for /phase-1-ship**

**Critical** (must fix):
- None ✅

**High** (should fix):
- None for initial release

**Medium** (can defer to follow-up PR):
- [ ] DRY: Extract repeated trade filtering logic to helper method (tracker.py:78-117)
- [ ] Consistency: Consolidate duplicate default targets (alerts.py:47, 60)
- [ ] Coverage: Add test for invalid window fallback (tracker.py:141-148)
- [ ] Timezone: CLI backfill mode should use UTC like tracker (cli.py:60)

**Low** (nice to have):
- [ ] API: Add explicit exports to __init__.py for cleaner imports

## Next Steps

- [x] Fix critical blockers (none identified)
- [x] Complete optimization validation
- [ ] Run `/phase-1-ship` to deploy to staging
- [ ] Monitor staging performance and alerts
- [ ] Address "Medium" items in follow-up PR after validation
