## Severity Guidelines

**Critical**: Production blocker, data corruption, security issue
- Example: Account balance incorrect, credentials exposed

**High**: Major functionality broken, workaround difficult

- Example: Cache not working (slower but functional)

**Low**: Minor issue, cosmetic, or edge case
- Example: Log message formatting incorrect
