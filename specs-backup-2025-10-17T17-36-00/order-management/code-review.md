# Code Review

## Findings

- None – unsupported order types now return a logged advisory instead of crashing (`src/trading_bot/bot.py:427-441`), and gateway calls retry on transient broker failures (`src/trading_bot/order_management/gateways.py:38-54`, `98-104`, `138-144`). Coverage for the feature sits at 95 % and Ruff reports a clean pass for the touched modules.

## Residual risks

- Documentation tasks T032–T035 remain outstanding; capture the operational artifacts before `/preview`.  
- Coverage is scoped to `src/trading_bot/order_management` for this release. Plan a follow-up to restore whole-project coverage once legacy modules gain tests.
