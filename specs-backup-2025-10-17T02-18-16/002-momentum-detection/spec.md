# Feature Specification: Momentum and Catalyst Detection

**Branch**: `002-momentum-detection`
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: Draft

## User Scenarios

### Primary User Story
A day trader wants to identify high-probability trading opportunities by finding stocks with breaking news catalysts, strong pre-market momentum, and bullish chart patterns (bull flags) that indicate potential continuation moves.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a list of stocks with recent news, **When** the system scans for catalyst events, **Then** it identifies stocks with breaking news within the last 24 hours and flags catalyst type (earnings, FDA approval, merger, etc.)
2. **Given** pre-market trading hours (4:00 AM - 9:30 AM EST), **When** the system monitors price action, **Then** it identifies stocks with >5% pre-market price movement and unusual volume (>200% average)
3. **Given** a stock with upward momentum, **When** the system scans for chart patterns, **Then** it detects bull flag formations (consolidation after strong move) and calculates breakout price targets
4. **Given** multiple momentum signals across different stocks, **When** the system ranks opportunities, **Then** it prioritizes stocks with multiple confluent signals (catalyst + momentum + pattern)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when pre-market data is unavailable or delayed?
- How does system handle stocks with news but no price movement?
- What if a bull flag pattern forms but breaks down instead of breaking out?
- How to handle conflicting signals (positive catalyst but weak price action)?
- What happens during market hours when pre-market momentum has already played out?

## User Stories (Prioritized)

> **Purpose**: Break down feature into independently deliverable stories for MVP-first delivery.
> **Format**: [P1] = MVP (ship first), [P2] = Enhancement, [P3] = Nice-to-have

## Visual References

Not applicable - backend/API feature with no UI components.

## Success Metrics (HEART Framework)

> **SKIP METRICS**: This is an internal trading system component with no direct user behavior to track. Success is measured by trading performance (win rate, P&L) rather than user engagement.

## Screens Inventory (UI Features Only)

> **SKIP SCREENS**: Backend-only feature (no UI components). Outputs are logged data and API responses consumed by trading strategy.

## Hypothesis

> **Not an improvement feature**: This is a new capability addition, not improving an existing flow.

## Context Strategy & Signal Design

- **System prompt altitude**: Detailed technical context for trading domain (catalyst types, chart patterns, time zones)
- **Tool surface**: Essential tools - news API, market data API, technical analysis library, logging
- **Examples in scope**:
  1. Bull flag pattern detection example with price data
  2. Catalyst categorization example (earnings vs FDA)
  3. Pre-market volume calculation example
- **Context budget**: Target 25k tokens (API data streams are verbose)
- **Retrieval strategy**: JIT for market data (fetch on demand), upfront for pattern definitions
- **Memory artifacts**: NOTES.md with pattern definitions, TODO.md for signal validation tasks
- **Compaction cadence**: Summarize every 10 API responses to avoid token overflow
- **Sub-agents**: None - single-agent implementation

git revert <commit>
git push
# No database migrations to reverse
```

## Dependencies and Blockers

### Dependencies
- **market-data-module**: Required for fetching pre-market data and historical prices
  - Status: Not implemented yet (in roadmap backlog)
  - Workaround: Can stub with static data for initial implementation
  - Critical path: Yes - needed for US2 and US3

- **technical-indicators**: Required for VWAP and pattern detection calculations
  - Status: In roadmap backlog
  - Workaround: Can implement basic calculations inline for MVP
  - Critical path: Partial - needed for US3 bull flag detection

- **news-api-integration**: Required for catalyst detection
  - Status: Not implemented
  - Workaround: Can use direct API calls for MVP
  - Critical path: Yes - needed for US1

### Blockers
- **API access**: Requires API keys for news source (NewsAPI, Finnhub, or Alpaca)
  - Resolution: User must obtain API key before testing
  - Impact: Cannot test catalyst detection without API access

- **Pre-market data availability**: Not all data providers offer pre-market data
  - Resolution: Must use Alpaca or similar provider with pre-market support
  - Impact: May need to change data provider

### Assumptions
- User has access to a market data provider with pre-market data (Alpaca recommended)
- News API provides categorized news (may need manual categorization for some sources)
- Bull flag pattern detection uses daily candles (not intraday for MVP)
- Pattern detection runs on-demand, not continuously (for MVP)
- Signals are logged for manual review (no automatic trading for MVP)

## Constitution Compliance

This feature adheres to Constitution v1.0.0:

- **Â§Safety_First**: All signals logged for manual review, no automatic trading
- **Â§Code_Quality**: Will implement with type hints, â‰¥90% test coverage, single-purpose functions
- **Â§Risk_Management**: Validates all API data, handles missing data gracefully
- **Â§Security**: API keys in environment variables only
- **Â§Data_Integrity**: All timestamps in UTC, data validation before processing
- **Â§Testing_Requirements**: Unit tests for all detection logic, integration tests with mocked APIs

## Success Criteria

The momentum and catalyst detection feature is successful when:

1. **Catalyst Detection**: System correctly identifies and categorizes at least 90% of major news events (earnings, FDA approvals, mergers) within 24 hours of publication
2. **Pre-Market Identification**: System detects pre-market movers (>5% change, >200% volume) with 95% accuracy compared to manual analysis
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Bull flag detection identifies valid patterns with 80% precision (patterns that meet criteria) and 70% recall (doesn't miss obvious patterns)
4. **Performance**: Complete scan of 500 stocks (catalyst + pre-market + pattern) in under 90 seconds
5. **Reliability**: System handles API failures gracefully with zero crashes over 30 days of operation
6. **Data Quality**: Zero timezone errors, zero invalid price/volume data processed
7. **Composite Scoring**: Stocks with multiple confluent signals (3+) show 60%+ win rate in paper trading validation
8. **Auditability**: 100% of detected signals logged with complete metadata for backtesting

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT included in this feature:

- Automatic trade execution based on momentum signals
- Real-time streaming data (MVP uses polling)
- Intraday pattern detection (MVP uses daily candles)
- Machine learning-based pattern recognition
- Social media sentiment analysis
- Options flow or dark pool data
- Integration with broker for direct order placement
- Mobile app or web UI (backend only)
- Historical backtesting framework (separate feature)
- Alert notifications (separate P3 user story)

## Next Steps

After specification approval:
1. Run `/clarify` if ambiguities remain
2. Run `/plan` to create technical design
3. Run `/tasks` to break down into implementation tasks
4. Implement US1 (catalyst detection) first, validate independently
5. Implement US2 (pre-market movers) second, validate independently
6. Implement US3 (bull flag patterns) third, validate independently
7. Implement US4 (composite scoring) to integrate signals
8. Paper trade validation with real market data
9. Ship to production with manual review gates
