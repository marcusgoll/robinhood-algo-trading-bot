- Quantity: 434 shares (within range 430-440) ✅
- Target price: $254.90 (2:1 ratio) ✅
- Risk amount: $1000.00 (~1% of $100k) ✅
- Reward ratio: 1.996:1 (≥1.95) ✅
- Pullback source: 'detected' (swing low found) ✅

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [✅] **AC-001**: Entry with automatic stop-loss - Pullback detection working
- [✅] **AC-003**: Position sizing based on account risk - Correct 1% calculation
- [⏳] **AC-002**: Place trade with risk management - Requires live trading
- [⏳] **AC-004**: Trailing stop adjustment - Requires live trading
- [⏳] **AC-005**: Auto-exit on target fill - Requires live trading

**Bot Integration**: ✅ Success
- RiskManager initialized correctly
- TargetMonitor initialized correctly
- Config loaded with risk_management section
- Paper trading mode active

## Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: .env File Parsing Warnings ✅
- **Description**: 50 duplicate DEVICE_TOKEN entries causing python-dotenv warnings
- **Impact**: Non-blocking startup warnings
- **Resolution**: Removed all duplicate entries from .env (lines 37-86)
- **Status**: FIXED

### Issue #2: Robinhood Paper Trading ✅
- **Description**: Robinhood API doesn't provide paper trading mode
- **Impact**: AC-002, AC-004, AC-005 require live trading to fully validate
- **Resolution**: Bot has internal paper trading simulation
- **Status**: MITIGATED - Core calculations validated, order execution will be tested in live mode

## Deployment Configuration

### Required Configuration

Add to `config.json`:

```json
{
  "paper_trading": true,
  "risk_management": {
    "account_risk_pct": 1.0,
    "min_risk_reward_ratio": 2.0,
    "default_stop_pct": 2.0,
    "trailing_enabled": true,
    "pullback_lookback_candles": 20,
    "trailing_breakeven_threshold": 0.5,
    "strategy_overrides": {}
  }
}
```

### Production Usage

**To enable in live trading**:
1. Verify `config.json` has `risk_management` section
2. Set `paper_trading: false` in config.json
3. Start bot: `python -m trading_bot`
4. Monitor logs: `Get-Content logs\risk-management.jsonl -Wait`

**Safety**: Bot will automatically calculate position sizes, place stops, and manage targets based on configured risk parameters.

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise in production trading:

### Quick Rollback

```bash
# 1. Stop trading bot
systemctl stop trading-bot

# 2. Manually close positions via Robinhood UI
#    - Cancel all stop-loss orders
#    - Cancel all target orders
#    - Close positions at market if needed

# 3. Revert configuration
# Edit config.json:
#   - Set "paper_trading": true
#   - Remove "risk_management" section (optional)

# 4. Restart in paper trading mode
systemctl start trading-bot

# 5. Verify paper trading active
tail -f logs/trading-bot.log | grep "paper_trading"
# Should show: "paper_trading mode ENABLED"
```

### Git Rollback (if needed)

```bash
git log --oneline -5  # Find commit before stop-loss-automation
git revert 24ef741    # Revert validation commit
git revert e3e2834    # Revert staging deployment
```

**WARNING**: Always manually close live positions before reverting code. Automated rollback WILL NOT cancel orders or close positions.

## Monitoring

### Production Metrics to Track

1. **Capital Protection**:
   - Max drawdown per trade ≤1% (target)
   - Stop-loss hit rate monitoring
   - Risk amount accuracy (±0.1%)

2. **Target Achievement**:
   - Target hit rate ≥40% (goal)
   - Average risk-reward ratio ≥1.8
   - Trailing stop effectiveness

3. **System Performance**:
   - Position calc time <200ms
   - Stop placement time <1s after entry fill
   - Circuit breaker triggers (>2% stop placement failures)

### Log Monitoring

**Risk Management Logs**:
```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
Get-Content logs\risk-management.jsonl -Wait

# Look for:
# - position_plan entries with pullback_source
# - stop_order_id and target_order_id
# - trailing_stop_adjustment events
# - position_closed with P&L
```

**Error Monitoring**:
```powershell
Get-Content logs\trading-bot.log -Wait | Select-String "ERROR"

# Watch for:
# - StopPlacementError
# - TargetAdjustmentError
# - PositionPlanningError
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Day 1-7)

- [ ] Monitor first 3-5 live trades in paper trading mode
- [ ] Verify position calculations match expectations
- [ ] Confirm stop/target orders placed correctly
- [ ] Observe trailing stop adjustments

### Short-term (Week 1-4)

- [ ] Enable live trading with small position sizes
- [ ] Track target hit rate (goal: ≥40%)
- [ ] Validate max drawdown stays ≤1%
- [ ] Complete validation of AC-002, AC-004, AC-005

### Long-term (Month 1-3)

- [ ] Analyze risk-reward performance (target: ≥1.8 avg)
- [ ] Review stop-loss effectiveness
- [ ] Optimize pullback lookback window if needed
- [ ] Consider strategy-specific risk overrides
