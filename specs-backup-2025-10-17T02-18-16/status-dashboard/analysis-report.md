## Cross-Artifact Consistency Checks

### Spec ↔ Plan Consistency

✅ **Architecture alignment**: Plan correctly identifies 5 reusable components and 4 new modules
✅ **Schema consistency**: Dataclasses in plan match entity definitions in spec
✅ **Performance targets**: Plan references spec's NFR-001 targets (<2s, <500ms, <1s)
✅ **Dependencies**: Plan identifies PyYAML requirement, matches spec deployment section
✅ **Market hours logic**: Plan's is_market_open() matches spec's FR-009 (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)

### Plan ↔ Tasks Consistency

✅ **All plan modules have tasks**: dashboard.py (T022-T023, T025), display_renderer.py (T019, T027), metrics_calculator.py (T018), export_generator.py (T020), time_utils extension (T017)
✅ **TDD coverage**: All 4 new modules have RED tests before GREEN implementation
✅ **Performance benchmarks**: Plan targets (NFR-001) have corresponding tasks (T036-T038)
✅ **Integration scenarios**: Plan's production use cases covered by integration tests (T030-T032)

### Spec ↔ Tasks Consistency

✅ **All FRs have test tasks**: Each FR-001 to FR-016 has corresponding RED test
✅ **All NFRs have validation**: NFR-001 (T036-T038), NFR-005 (T028), NFR-006 (T043), NFR-007 (T033-T034)
✅ **Acceptance scenarios**: All 6 spec scenarios covered by manual acceptance test (T042)
✅ **Edge cases**: Spec's 6 edge cases covered by error handling integration tests (T032)

## Issues Found

### Critical Issues (0)

No critical issues detected.

### High Issues (0)

No high-priority issues detected.

### Medium Issues (2)

**M-001: TDD Ordering Assumption**
- **Location**: tasks.md Phase 3.3
- **Issue**: GREEN tasks (T017-T026) assume all RED tests (T004-T016) pass, but no explicit checkpoint
- **Impact**: Could proceed with implementation before test suite validates requirements
- **Recommendation**: Add explicit task after T016: "Verify all RED tests fail as expected"
- **Severity**: Medium (process risk, not technical blocker)

**M-002: Terminology Variant - "Dashboard" vs "Status Dashboard"**
- **Location**: Spec title uses "CLI Status Dashboard", tasks use "dashboard" module name
- **Issue**: Minor naming inconsistency across artifacts
- **Impact**: No functional impact, but could cause confusion in documentation
- **Recommendation**: Standardize on "status_dashboard" or "dashboard" consistently
- **Severity**: Medium (documentation clarity)

### Low Issues (1)

**L-001: Potential Duplicate - Staleness Logic**
- **Location**: FR-010 (staleness indicator) and NFR-002 (graceful degradation)
- **Issue**: Both requirements address stale data handling, some overlap
- **Impact**: No functional duplication in tasks (T009 handles display, T032 handles errors)
- **Recommendation**: Consider clarifying FR-010 as "UI indicator" vs NFR-002 as "error handling"
- **Severity**: Low (requirements could be more distinct, but tasks are correctly separated)

---

## Validation Results

### Architecture Validation

✅ **Separation of concerns**: DisplayRenderer (UI) separate from MetricsCalculator (logic)
✅ **Reuse strategy**: Correctly identifies 5 existing components to reuse
✅ **Graceful degradation**: Error handling built into architecture (optional targets, missing logs)
✅ **Performance design**: Leverages AccountData cache (60s TTL) to avoid API spam
✅ **No breaking changes**: Additive module, no modifications to existing codebase

### Security Validation

✅ **Read-only dashboard**: No trade execution or account modifications
✅ **Authentication inherited**: Uses existing AccountData service (no new auth required)
✅ **Input validation**: Keyboard input limited to single-char commands (R/E/Q/H)
✅ **Safe YAML parsing**: Plan specifies yaml.safe_load (no code execution)
✅ **PII handling**: Inherits AccountData masking, no new account number exposure

### Testing Strategy Validation

✅ **Unit test coverage**: 13 RED tests cover all critical functions
✅ **Integration tests**: 3 integration tests cover end-to-end scenarios
✅ **Performance benchmarks**: 3 benchmark tasks validate NFR-001 targets
✅ **Manual acceptance**: 10-point checklist covers all 6 acceptance scenarios
✅ **Error injection**: Integration test (T032) validates graceful degradation

### Data Integrity Validation

✅ **UTC timestamps**: Dataclasses use datetime with UTC requirement (NFR-004)
✅ **Decimal precision**: Plan uses Decimal for all currency values (P&L, buying power)
✅ **Type safety**: All dataclasses have type hints, mypy validation (T028)
✅ **Audit logging**: Usage events logged to dashboard-usage.jsonl (NFR-007)
✅ **No data mutations**: Dashboard read-only, no risk of corrupting trade logs or account data

## Recommendations

### Required Before Implementation

None - all critical requirements satisfied.

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Add RED test checkpoint task** (addresses M-001)
   - Insert after T016: "T016.5 [P] Verify all RED tests fail with 'NotImplementedError'"
   - Benefits: Validates test suite before proceeding to GREEN phase
   - Effort: ~5 minutes

2. **Standardize module naming** (addresses M-002)
   - Decision: Use "dashboard" (simpler) vs "status_dashboard" (explicit)
   - Update: Ensure spec title, plan module names, and tasks.md use same terminology
   - Effort: ~10 minutes

3. **Clarify FR-010 vs NFR-002 distinction** (addresses L-001)
   - FR-010: "UI displays staleness indicator when data >60s old"
   - NFR-002: "System continues operating when API errors occur"
   - Benefit: Clearer separation of UI concern vs reliability concern
   - Effort: ~5 minutes

### Optional Enhancements

None - feature scope is well-defined and appropriately sized.

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

**Low Risk**: API rate limiting during polling
- Mitigation: AccountData cache (60s TTL) limits to 12 calls/minute vs 600 limit
- Fallback: Staleness indicator alerts user to cached data

**Low Risk**: Large trade log files slow performance
- Mitigation: TradeQueryHelper streams JSONL (tested <15ms for 1000 trades)
- Fallback: Only query today's trades (single file, typically <1KB)

**Low Risk**: Terminal size compatibility
- Mitigation: Rich responsive layout, truncates if needed
- Fallback: Display warning if terminal too small (80x24 minimum)

### Process Risks

**Medium Risk**: TDD ordering assumption (M-001)
- Mitigation: Add checkpoint task after RED phase
- Impact: Could waste time implementing against unvalidated tests

**Low Risk**: Terminology inconsistency (M-002)
- Mitigation: Standardize naming across artifacts
- Impact: Documentation confusion, no functional impact

### Business Risks

**None identified** - Feature is internal CLI tool, no user-facing impact
