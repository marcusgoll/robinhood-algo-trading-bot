### 5. Dependency Analysis

| Dependency | Type | Status | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|------|--------|--------|------------|
| MarketDataService | Existing | Available | None | Reuse confirmed in tasks.md |
| TradingLogger | Existing | Available | None | Reuse confirmed in tasks.md |
| @with_retry | Existing | Available | None | Reuse confirmed in tasks.md |
| NEWS_API_KEY | External | User-provided | Blocking for US1 | T016: Graceful degradation if missing |
| MARKET_DATA_API_KEY | External | Likely available | Blocking for US2/US3 | Plan assumes Alpaca already integrated |
| Pre-market data availability | External | Alpaca-dependent | Blocking for US2 | Spec notes: Use Alpaca for pre-market support |
| pandas (optional) | External | Not required for MVP | None | Plan Phase 2: Optional optimization |

**Dependency Risk**: Low (only external dependencies are API keys, gracefully handled)

---

### 6. Task Ordering Validation

**Dependency Graph Check**:
- Phase 1 (T001-T003): Setup - No dependencies (Correct)
- Phase 2 (T005-T007): Foundational - Blocks Phase 3-6 (Correct)
- Phase 3 (T011-T017): US1 - Depends on Phase 2 (Correct)
- Phase 4 (T021-T028): US2 - Depends on Phase 2 (Correct)
- Phase 5 (T031-T040): US3 - Depends on Phase 2 (Correct)
- Phase 6 (T041-T047): US4 - Depends on Phase 3-5 (Correct)
- Phase 7 (T050-T052): Composition - Depends on Phase 3-6 (Correct)
- Phase 8 (T055-T066): Polish - Depends on Phase 7 (Correct)

**Parallelization Check**:
- Phase 2: T005, T006, T007 marked [P] (Correct - different files)
- Phase 3: T011, T012 marked [P] (Correct - test files)
- Phase 4: T021, T022 marked [P] (Correct - test files)
- Phase 5: T031, T032, T033 marked [P] (Correct - test files)

**Result**: Task ordering is valid, no circular dependencies detected

## Findings

### Critical Issues (0)

None found. All blocking issues resolved.

---

### High Issues (0)

None found. Feature is well-specified and architected.

---

### Medium Issues (2)

**M1: API Provider Choice Ambiguity**
- **Location**: spec.md FR-001, plan.md Research Decisions
- **Issue**: Spec says "NewsAPI, Finnhub, or Alpaca" but plan chooses Alpaca without documented decision rationale
- **Impact**: Low - Alpaca is valid choice and consistent with existing MarketDataService
- **Recommendation**: Update spec.md Dependencies section to note "Using Alpaca for consistency with existing integration"
- **Blocker**: No

**M2: Pattern Threshold Tuning Risk**
- **Location**: spec.md FR-006, tasks.md T036-T039
- **Issue**: Bull flag thresholds (8%, 3-5%, etc.) are fixed but may need adjustment based on market conditions
- **Impact**: Low - Can be tuned in Phase 2 after paper trading validation
- **Recommendation**: Add Phase 9 task for backtesting-driven threshold optimization
- **Blocker**: No

---

### Low Issues (1)

**L1: Optional pandas Dependency**
- **Location**: plan.md Dependencies section
- **Issue**: Plan mentions "optional pandas for Phase 2" but doesn't specify trigger for adding it
- **Impact**: Minimal - MVP doesn't need it
- **Recommendation**: Document in NOTES.md: "Add pandas when processing >1000 stocks or optimizing OHLCV manipulation"
- **Blocker**: No

---

## Architecture Risks

### Low Risk

1. **Service Composition Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Four independent services could have integration issues
   - **Mitigation**: MomentumEngine composition root (T050) + E2E test (T066) validates integration
   - **Status**: Mitigated

2. **API Rate Limiting**
   - **Risk**: News API free tier (500 req/day) may be insufficient
   - **Mitigation**: @with_retry handles rate limit errors, caching planned for Phase 2
   - **Status**: Acceptable for MVP

3. **Pattern Detection Accuracy**
   - **Risk**: Manual pattern detection may miss complex formations
   - **Mitigation**: Phase 2 can add `ta` library or ML-based detection
   - **Status**: Acceptable for MVP (paper trading will validate)

## Security Validation

| Control | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| API keys in env vars | Pass | T006, T062 |

| Input validation | Pass | T056: Regex validation for symbols |
| Rate limiting | Pass | T057: @with_retry decorator |
| Error logging (no PII) | Pass | MomentumLogger logs only stock data |

**Security Assessment**: No vulnerabilities identified

---

## Performance Validation

| Requirement | Target | Plan Implementation | Status |
|-------------|--------|---------------------|--------|

1. **Clarify API Provider Choice** (M1)
   - Update spec.md Dependencies section to explicitly state "Using Alpaca (already integrated)"
   - Effort: 5 minutes
   - Impact: Eliminates ambiguity

2. **Add Threshold Tuning Task** (M2)
   - Add Phase 9 task: "T070: Backtest bull flag detection thresholds and adjust based on precision/recall"
   - Effort: 4-8 hours (Phase 2)
   - Impact: Improves pattern detection accuracy

---

### Nice-to-Have (1 item)

1. **Document pandas Trigger** (L1)

3. Execute Phase 6 (US4 composite scoring) - 2-3 hours
4. Execute Phase 7 (composition + API) - 3-4 hours
5. Execute Phase 8 (polish + tests) - 5-7 hours
6. Manual testing and paper trading validation - 4-6 hours

## Summary

The momentum-detection feature artifacts (spec, plan, tasks) are **production-ready** and fully aligned with project constitution. All 20 requirements are mapped to 41 concrete tasks with comprehensive test coverage (>=90% target). No critical or high-priority issues block implementation.

The feature follows established patterns (Service-Oriented Architecture, existing reusable components), has clear acceptance criteria, and includes robust error handling. Performance targets are achievable with planned parallel execution strategy.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to /implement phase immediately.
