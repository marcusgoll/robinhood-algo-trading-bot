## Findings

| ID | Severity | Category | Location | Description | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| C001 | HIGH | Constitution | spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md | Circuit breaker/fail-safe principle (Safety_First) not explicitly addressed | Add validation task for error handling that ensures failures halt detection gracefully rather than continuing with invalid data |
| C002 | MEDIUM | Coverage | tasks.md | NFR-002 (accuracy/false positive rate <15%) has no validation task | Add task to validate false positive rate through backtesting or historical data validation |
| C003 | MEDIUM | Risk | spec.md, plan.md | Pattern detection is stateless - no trade history tracking mentioned | Consider if pattern detection should track previously detected patterns to prevent duplicate signals (aligns with §Data_Integrity) |
| C004 | LOW | Terminology | spec.md L209 | Uses "stop_loss" (underscore) in JSON example | Maintain consistency - use "stop_loss" throughout or standardize to "stop-loss" |
| C005 | LOW | Documentation | tasks.md | T041, T042 marked [P] but may have sequential dependency | Verify mypy and flake8 can run in parallel or mark sequential |
| C006 | LOW | Completeness | plan.md | No explicit mention of logging strategy for audit trail | Add logging requirements to align with constitution §Safety_First "Audit everything" |

## Consistency Analysis

### Terminology

**Consistent Terms** (used uniformly across artifacts):
- TechnicalIndicatorsService (34 references)
- BullFlagDetector, BullFlagConfig, BullFlagResult (38 references)
- Decimal precision (16 references)
- 90% test coverage (15 references)
- 30 bars minimum (4 references)

**Minor Inconsistency**:
- "stop_loss" vs "stop-loss" - Mixed usage but both refer to same concept (not critical)

### Thresholds and Parameters

**Verified Consistency**:
- Flagpole minimum gain: 5% (consistent across spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md)
- Consolidation retracement: 20-50% (consistent)
- Breakout volume increase: 30% (consistent)
- Risk/reward minimum: 2:1 (consistent)
- Test coverage target: 90% (consistent)
- Performance target: <5s for 100 stocks (consistent)

### Architecture Decisions

**Consistency Check**:
- ✅ Composition pattern (instantiate TechnicalIndicatorsService, no modifications) - Confirmed in plan.md and tasks.md T026
- ✅ Dataclass pattern with Decimal precision - Confirmed matches existing indicators module
- ✅ TDD approach with tests before implementation - Confirmed in Phase 3 tasks
- ✅ Multi-phase detection flow - Confirmed in plan.md and implementation tasks T016-T018

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation in Place | Status |
|------|----------|---------------------|--------|
| Performance degradation | Medium | Early exit strategy, performance benchmark (T034) | ✅ Mitigated |
| False positives | Medium | Multi-phase validation, quality scoring, conservative defaults | ⚠️ Partial - add backtesting validation |
| Breaking changes to indicators | Low | Composition pattern, regression tests (T036) | ✅ Mitigated |
| Insufficient test coverage | Low | TDD approach, coverage validation (T035) | ✅ Mitigated |
| Configuration complexity | Low | Sensible defaults, __post_init__ validation (T007) | ✅ Mitigated |

### Integration Risks

| Integration Point | Risk Level | Validation Strategy | Status |
|-------------------|------------|---------------------|--------|
| TechnicalIndicatorsService | Low | Integration tests (T025), regression tests (T036) | ✅ Ready |
| Market Data Input | Low | Input validation in detect() method, InsufficientDataError | ✅ Ready |
| Signal Output | Low | Structured BullFlagResult dataclass, well-defined schema | ✅ Ready |

## Quality Gate Validation

### Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [x] All functional requirements mapped to tasks (7/7)
- [x] All NFRs have validation strategy (3/4 - NFR-002 needs backtesting)
- [x] Constitution principles addressed (5/6 - Safety_First partial)
- [x] Consistent terminology across artifacts
- [x] Numeric thresholds consistent (5%, 20-50%, 30%, 2:1, 90%)
- [x] Architecture decisions documented and consistent
- [x] Integration points identified and validated
- [x] Test strategy comprehensive (TDD, integration, regression, performance)
- [x] Risk mitigation strategies defined
- [x] Parallel execution opportunities identified (14 tasks)

### Recommended Actions Before /implement

1. **Add NFR-002 validation task** (Medium priority):
   - Task: "Validate false positive rate using historical pattern data"
   - Acceptance: FP rate <15% on test dataset
   - Phase: 6 (Testing & Validation)

2. **Clarify fail-safe behavior** (High priority):
   - Document: What happens when pattern detection encounters corrupt data?
   - Add: Error handling tests to ensure graceful degradation
   - Reference: Constitution §Safety_First "Fail safe, not fail open"

3. **Consider signal deduplication** (Low priority):
   - Optional: Track recently detected patterns to prevent duplicate signals within N bars
   - Aligns with: Constitution §Data_Integrity

## Next Phase Readiness

### Ready for /implement: ✅ YES

**Strengths**:
1. Comprehensive requirement coverage (100%)
2. Consistent architecture and terminology
3. Well-defined test strategy with TDD approach
4. Clear integration points with existing codebase
5. Risk mitigation strategies documented
6. Performance and quality gates defined

**Minor Gaps** (non-blocking):
1. NFR-002 validation task missing (false positive rate)
2. Circuit breaker/fail-safe behavior not explicitly documented
3. Signal deduplication strategy not addressed

**Recommendation**: Proceed to /implement phase. Address minor gaps during implementation as follows:
- Add error handling tests in Phase 6 to validate fail-safe behavior
- Consider adding backtesting validation task if historical data is available
- Document signal deduplication strategy in implementation phase if needed
