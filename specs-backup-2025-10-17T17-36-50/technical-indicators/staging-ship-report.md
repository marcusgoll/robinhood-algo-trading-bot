## Critical Issues Resolved

### CR-1: Missing Symbol Field ✅ FIXED
**Impact**: API contract violation
**Root Cause**: Result dataclasses missing required field
**Fix Applied**: Added `symbol: str` field to:
- `VWAPResult`
- `EMAResult`
- `MACDResult`
**Verification**: All 56 tests pass, no regressions

### CR-2: MACD Signal Line Stub ✅ FIXED
**Impact**: Core MACD functionality broken
**Root Cause**: Signal line hardcoded as MACD line value
**Fix Applied**: Implemented proper 9-period EMA calculation:
1. Build array of MACD values for all bars
2. Calculate 9-period EMA of MACD values
3. Fallback to SMA for < 9 values
4. Histogram now calculates correctly
**Verification**: All 56 tests pass, histogram working properly

## Integration Instructions

### 1. Module Location
```
src/trading_bot/indicators/
├── __init__.py          # Module exports
├── calculators.py       # VWAP, EMA, MACD calculators
├── config.py           # Configuration system
├── exceptions.py       # Custom exceptions
└── service.py          # Service facade
```

### 2. Basic Usage

```python
from src.trading_bot.indicators.service import TechnicalIndicatorsService
from src.trading_bot.indicators.config import IndicatorConfig

# Initialize service
config = IndicatorConfig()  # Uses defaults
service = TechnicalIndicatorsService()

# Calculate indicators
bars = [{"high": 100, "low": 99, "close": 99.5, "volume": 1000}, ...]

vwap_result = service.get_vwap(bars)
ema_result = service.get_emas(bars)
macd_result = service.get_macd(bars)

# Validate entry conditions
is_valid, reason = service.validate_entry(bars)

# Check for exit signals
exit_signal = service.check_exit_signals(bars)
```

### 3. Test Suite Integration

```bash
# Run all indicators tests
pytest tests/indicators/ -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/indicators/ --cov=src/trading_bot/indicators

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/indicators/test_service.py -v
```

### 4. Configuration

```python
from src.trading_bot.indicators.config import IndicatorConfig

# Custom configuration
config = IndicatorConfig(
    vwap_min_bars=15,
    ema_periods=[9, 20, 50],
    ema_proximity_threshold_pct=1.5,
    macd_fast_period=10,
    macd_slow_period=25,
    macd_signal_period=7,
    refresh_interval_seconds=600
