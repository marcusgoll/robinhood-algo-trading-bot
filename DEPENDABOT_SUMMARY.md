## Closed PRs (2) - Require Manual Review

### 1. pytest-cov 4.1.0 → 7.0.0 ❌ Closed
**Reason:** Major version bump with breaking changes

**Breaking Changes:**
- Removed subprocess measurement by default
- Requires coverage >= 7.10.6
- `.pth` file behavior changed

**Action Required:**
- Review coverage configuration (.coveragerc)
- May need to add: `[run] patch = subprocess`
- Verify coverage >= 7.10.6 compatibility
- Test coverage collection locally before upgrading

**GitHub Issue:** #1

### 2. numpy 1.26.3 → 2.3.4 ❌ Closed
**Reason:** Major version bump with breaking changes

**Breaking Changes:**
- NumPy 2.0 introduced significant API changes
- May break existing numerical code
- Requires pandas compatibility verification

**Action Required:**
- Review NumPy 2.0 migration guide
- Test all backtesting and calculation code
- Verify pandas 2.3.3 works with numpy 2.x
- Update any deprecated API usage
- Run full test suite locally

**GitHub Issue:** #5
