1. Filter by invalid date range (end before start)
   ✓ Shows validation error
   ✓ Error message explains issue
   ✓ Form field highlighted in red
   ✓ Focus moved to invalid field
```

**Quality check**: Errors handled gracefully with user-friendly messages.

---

### Step 4: Test Responsive Design (if HAS_UI=true)

**Actions**:
Test on multiple screen sizes using browser dev tools:

**Example**:
```markdown
## Responsive Testing

**Desktop** (1920x1080):
✓ Dashboard displays full-width chart
✓ All controls visible
✓ No horizontal scrolling

**Tablet** (768x1024):
✓ Chart resizes appropriately
✓ Controls stack vertically
✓ Touch targets ≥44x44px
✓ No content cut off

**Mobile** (375x667):
✓ Chart readable (not cramped)
✓ Navigation accessible (hamburger menu)
✓ Text readable (font size ≥16px)
✓ No tiny tap targets
```

**Quality check**: Works on desktop, tablet, mobile without horizontal scroll or cut-off content.

---

### Step 5: Test Keyboard Navigation

**Actions**:
Test keyboard accessibility:

**Example**:
```markdown
## Keyboard Navigation

1. Tab through all interactive elements
   ✓ Tab order logical (top to bottom, left to right)
   ✓ All buttons/links reachable via Tab
   ✓ Focus indicators visible (blue outline)
   ✓ No keyboard traps (can Tab out of all elements)

2. Activate elements with Enter/Space
   ✓ Buttons activate on Enter or Space
   ✓ Links activate on Enter
   ✓ Dropdowns open with Enter, navigate with arrows

3. Test Escape key
   ✓ Modals close with Esc
   ✓ Dropdowns close with Esc
   ✓ Focus returns to trigger element

4. Test form navigation
   ✓ Tab moves between form fields
   ✓ Enter submits form (if expected)
   ✓ Can navigate back with Shift+Tab
```

**Quality check**: All functionality accessible via keyboard, no keyboard traps.

---

### Step 6: Visual Regression Check

**Actions**:
Compare new UI against design expectations:

**Example**:
```markdown
## Visual Regression Check

**Layout**:
✓ Matches design mockup (if exists)
✓ Spacing consistent (margins, padding)
✓ Alignment correct (left/center/right)
✓ No overlapping elements

**Typography**:
✓ Font sizes match design system
✓ Line heights readable
✓ Text not cut off

**Colors**:
✓ Matches brand colors
✓ Sufficient contrast (≥4.5:1 for text)
✓ Hover/focus states visible

**Images/Icons**:
✓ Images load correctly
✓ Icons aligned properly
✓ No broken image placeholders
✓ Alt text present (check in HTML)

**Animations**:
✓ Smooth (60fps)
✓ Not distracting
✓ Can be disabled (if motion-sensitive)
```

**Quality check**: UI matches design system, no visual regressions.

---

### Step 7: Test Performance in Browser

**Actions**:
Manual performance checks:

**Example**:
```markdown
## Performance Check

**Page Load**:
1. Open Chrome DevTools → Network tab → Hard refresh
   ✓ FCP <1.5s (measured in Performance tab)
   ✓ LCP <2.5s
   ✓ No render-blocking resources >500ms

**Interactions**:
1. Click button, time response
   ✓ Button click → UI update <100ms
   ✓ Form submit → feedback <500ms
   ✓ API call → data displayed <1s

**Smooth Scrolling**:
1. Scroll page with mouse wheel
   ✓ No jank (stuttering)
   ✓ 60fps (check in DevTools Performance)
   ✓ Scroll position maintained on back button
```

**Quality check**: Feels fast and responsive, no janky interactions.

---

### Step 8: Cross-Reference Success Criteria

**Actions**:
For each success criterion from spec.md, manually verify:

**Example**:
```markdown
## Success Criteria Validation

### From spec.md:

1. "User can complete registration in <3 minutes"
   - **Manual test**: Timed user flow
   - **Result**: 2.1 minutes ✓
   - **Notes**: Clear instructions, minimal friction

2. "Dashboard displays completion rate, time spent, last activity"
   - **Manual test**: Verified all 3 fields present
   - **Result**: All present ✓
   - **Notes**: Data accurate (cross-checked with DB)

3. "Lighthouse accessibility score ≥95"
   - **Already tested**: Automated (optimization phase)
   - **Manual verify**: Keyboard nav works ✓

4. "95% of user searches return results in <1 second"
   - **Manual test**: Searched 20 times, 19 were <1s
   - **Result**: 95% ✓
   - **Notes**: One slow search had 5000+ results (edge case)
```

**Quality check**: All success criteria verified through manual testing.

### Step 9: Document Issues Found

**Actions**:
If any issues found during preview:

**Example**:
```markdown
## Issues Found During Preview

### Issue 1: Chart not responsive on mobile
**Severity**: Medium
**Steps to reproduce**:
1. Open dashboard on mobile (375px width)
2. Chart overflows container
**Expected**: Chart resizes to fit
**Actual**: Horizontal scroll required
**Fix required**: Yes (blocking)

### Issue 2: Unclear error message
**Severity**: Low
**Steps to reproduce**:

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 🚫 Incomplete User Flow Testing

**Impact**: Broken production UX, user complaints

**Scenario**:
```
Tested happy path only:
- User logs in ✓
- Views dashboard ✓
- Didn't test error scenarios

Production: User hits 404 error, sees stack trace (not handled)
```

**Prevention**:
- Test happy path + 2-3 error scenarios
- Test edge cases (empty states, max limits, invalid inputs)
- Don't skip error handling tests

---

### 🚫 Skipping Responsive Testing

**Impact**: Broken mobile experience

**Scenario**:
```
Tested on desktop only (1920px)
Mobile users (375px):
- Chart overflows screen
- Buttons too small to tap
- Text unreadable
```

**Prevention**:
- Test on 3 screen sizes minimum (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Use browser dev tools responsive mode
- Verify touch targets ≥44x44px on mobile

---

### 🚫 No Keyboard Navigation Testing

**Impact**: Excludes keyboard users, accessibility failures

**Scenario**:
```
Tested with mouse only
Keyboard users cannot:
- Tab to all buttons
- Activate dropdowns
- Close modals
- Navigate forms
```

**Prevention**:
- Tab through entire feature
- Test Enter/Space/Esc keys
- Verify focus indicators visible
- No keyboard traps

---

### 🚫 Rushed Preview (Checkbox Exercise)

**Impact**: Misses real issues

**Bad preview**:
```
✓ Loads (didn't actually test flows)
✓ Looks good (didn't check on mobile)
✓ Works (didn't test error cases)
Time: 5 minutes
```

**Good preview**:
```
✓ Happy path: Teacher views student progress (tested step-by-step)
✓ Error: Invalid student ID shows user-friendly message (tested)
✓ Responsive: Works on 375px, 768px, 1920px (tested each)
✓ Keyboard: All features accessible via Tab/Enter (tested)
✓ Performance: Interactions feel instant (timed)
Time: 45 minutes
```

**Prevention**: Allocate adequate time (30-60 min), test thoroughly

- Steps to reproduce
- Screenshot or screen recording
- Expected vs actual

**Result**: Clear communication, easy to understand and fix

---

### ✅ User-Centric Release Notes

**Write for users, not developers**:

**Bad** (technical):
```
- Implemented GET /api/v1/students/{id}/progress endpoint
- Added StudentProgressService with calculateProgress() method
- Created React component ProgressDashboard
```

**Good** (user-friendly):
```
- View detailed student progress from Students page
- See completion rate, time spent, and last activity
- Filter progress by date range (7, 30, or 90 days)
```

**Result**: Users understand what changed and how to use it

---
