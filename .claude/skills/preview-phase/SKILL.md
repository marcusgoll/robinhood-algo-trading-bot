# Preview Phase: Lessons Learned

> **Dynamic data**: Frequencies, metrics, and usage statistics are tracked in [learnings.md](learnings.md) (preserved across npm updates).

**Capability**: Learn from manual testing and preview validation to catch UX issues before deployment.

**When I trigger**:
- `/preview` starts â†’ Load lessons to guide manual testing checklist
- Preview complete â†’ Detect if user flows broken, visual issues missed
- Error: Issue found in staging that should have been caught in preview â†’ Capture

**Supporting files**:
- [reference.md](reference.md) - Manual testing checklist, user flow validation, visual regression detection
- [examples.md](examples.md) - Thorough preview (catches issues) vs rushed preview (misses issues)
