# Analysis Phase Examples

## Good Analysis (Catches Issues)

**Found**:
- Spec requirement missing from plan (export feature)
- Plan component missing from tasks (email notifications)
- Breaking change flagged (API response format change)

**Result**: Issues fixed before implementation

## Bad Analysis (Missed Issues)

**Missed**:
- Breaking database migration
- Missing authentication requirement
- Performance target not translated to tasks

**Result**: Rework during implementation
