# Analysis Phase: Standard Operating Procedure

> **Training Guide**: Validate cross-artifact consistency and detect breaking changes.

## Phase Overview
**Purpose**: Review work and identify potential breaking changes or inconsistencies.
**Inputs**: All workflow artifacts
**Outputs**: analysis-report.md with findings
**Expected duration**: 15-30 minutes

## Execution Steps
1. Check spec-plan consistency
2. Verify task-implementation alignment
3. Detect breaking changes (API, database, UI)
4. Validate dependencies
5. Generate analysis report

## Common Mistakes
- Missing breaking change detection
- Inconsistent artifacts
- No cross-reference validation

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] All artifacts consistent
- [ ] Breaking changes documented
- [ ] Analysis report generated
