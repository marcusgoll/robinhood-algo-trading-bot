# Finalize Phase: Lessons Learned

> **Dynamic data**: Frequencies, metrics, and usage statistics are tracked in [learnings.md](learnings.md) (preserved across npm updates).

**Capability**: Learn from workflow finalization to ensure complete documentation, roadmap updates, and proper archival.

**When I trigger**:
- `/finalize` starts → Load lessons to guide completion checklist
- Finalize complete → Detect if steps skipped, documentation incomplete
- Error: Missing artifacts or roadmap updates → Capture

**Supporting files**:
- [reference.md](reference.md) - Finalization checklist, archival procedures, documentation standards
- [examples.md](examples.md) - Complete finalization vs rushed cleanup

## Common Pitfalls (Auto-Updated)

### 🚫 Roadmap Not Updated

**Frequency**: ★☆☆☆☆ (0/5 - not yet seen)
**Last seen**: Never
**Impact**: Medium (roadmap stale, lost tracking)

**Prevention**:
1. Move feature from "In Progress" to "Shipped" in roadmap
2. Add links to ship report and production URL
3. Update feature status with completion date

---

### 🚫 Incomplete Documentation

**Frequency**: ★☆☆☆☆ (0/5 - not yet seen)
**Last seen**: Never
**Impact**: Medium (knowledge loss, onboarding friction)

**Prevention**:
1. Verify release notes created
2. Update README if user-facing feature
3. Archive all artifacts (spec, plan, tasks, reports)

## Successful Patterns (Auto-Updated)

### ✅ Complete Finalization Checklist

**Approach**:
- [ ] Roadmap updated (moved to "Shipped")
- [ ] Release notes created
- [ ] Ship report archived
- [ ] Production URL documented
- [ ] README updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Branch deleted (if no longer needed)

**Results**: Clean workflow completion, knowledge preserved
