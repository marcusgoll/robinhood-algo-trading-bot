# Roadmap Integration: Standard Operating Procedure

> **Training Guide**: Manage product roadmap with ICE prioritization.

## Phase Overview
**Purpose**: Brainstorm features, prioritize with ICE scoring, track shipped features
**Inputs**: Feature ideas, user requests
**Outputs**: Updated roadmap with prioritization
**Expected duration**: 30-60 minutes

## Execution Steps
1. Brainstorm features (new ideas)
2. Score with ICE (Impact × Confidence / Effort)
3. Prioritize by ICE score
4. Move features between states (Backlog → Next → In Progress → Shipped)
5. Link specs to roadmap entries

## Common Mistakes
- Roadmap sync issues
- Missing ICE scores
- State transitions unclear

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] Features scored with ICE
- [ ] Roadmap prioritized
- [ ] Links to specs added
