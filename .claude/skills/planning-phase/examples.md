# Planning Phase Examples

## Good Plan Example

**High code reuse**:
- Identified 3 existing base classes to extend
- Reused validation utilities
- Leveraged existing API patterns
- Code reuse: ~70%

## Bad Plan Example

**Reinventing wheels**:
- Created new base model (base already exists)
- Wrote custom validation (utility exists)
- Ignored existing patterns
- Code reuse: ~20%

_Expand with real examples as features are planned._
