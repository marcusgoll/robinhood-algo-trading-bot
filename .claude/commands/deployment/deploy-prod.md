> **⚠️  INTERNAL COMMAND**: This command is called automatically by `/ship` when deployment model is `direct-prod`.
> Most users should use `/ship` instead of calling this directly.

# /deploy-prod - Direct Production Deployment

**Purpose**: Deploy directly to production for projects without staging environments. This command is called by `/ship` when deployment model is `direct-prod`.

**When to Use**:
- Projects without staging branch or workflow
- Single-environment deployments
- Simple applications with minimal infrastructure

**Risk Level**: 🔴 HIGH - deploys directly to production without staging validation

**Prerequisites**:
- `/implement` phase complete
- `/optimize` phase complete
- `/preview` manual gate approved
- Pre-flight validation passed

---

## Phase DP.1: Pre-Deployment Checks

**Purpose**: Final safety checks before production deployment

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -Eeuo pipefail

# Error trap to ensure proper cleanup on failure
on_error() {
  echo "⚠️  Error in /deploy-prod. Marking phase as failed."
  complete_phase_timing "$FEATURE_DIR" "ship:deploy-prod" 2>/dev/null || true
  update_workflow_phase "$FEATURE_DIR" "ship:deploy-prod" "failed" 2>/dev/null || true
}
trap on_error ERR

# Always start at repo root
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"

# Tool preflight checks
need() {
  command -v "$1" >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
    echo "❌ Missing required tool: $1"
    echo "   Install via: brew install $1  # or appropriate package manager"
    exit 1
  }
}

need git
need yq
need jq
need gh
need curl

echo ""
```

**Blocking Conditions**:
- Pre-flight validation failed
- Optimization not complete
- Preview not approved
- No production workflow file
- Workflow missing `workflow_dispatch` trigger

**Changes from v1.x**:
- ✅ Added strict bash mode (`set -Eeuo pipefail`)
- ✅ Added error trap for cleanup
- ✅ Added tool preflight checks
- ✅ Fixed typo on line 54 (`n#` → `#`)
- ✅ Added workflow_dispatch verification

---

## Phase DP.2: Trigger Production Deployment

**Purpose**: Trigger GitHub Actions workflow for production deployment

```bash
echo "🔧 Phase DP.2: Trigger Production Deployment"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""

echo "Production workflow: $PROD_WORKFLOW"
echo ""

# Get current branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"

# Fail fast if uncommitted changes detected (non-interactive)
if ! git diff --quiet || ! git diff --cached --quiet; then
  echo "❌ Uncommitted changes detected"
  echo ""
  echo "Production deployments must be from a clean working tree."
  echo ""
  echo "Fix options:"
  echo "  1. Commit changes: git add . && git commit -m 'chore: prepare for deployment'"
  echo "  2. Stash changes: git stash"
  echo "  3. Discard changes: git restore ."
  echo ""
  exit 1
fi

# Push to remote if needed
REMOTE_BRANCH="origin/$CURRENT_BRANCH"
if ! git rev-parse "$REMOTE_BRANCH" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo ""
  echo "📤 Pushing branch to remote..."
  git push -u origin "$CURRENT_BRANCH"
else
  LOCAL_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
  REMOTE_SHA=$(git rev-parse "$REMOTE_BRANCH")

  if [ "$LOCAL_SHA" != "$REMOTE_SHA" ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "📤 Pushing updates to remote..."
    git push
  fi
fi

echo ""
echo "🚀 Triggering production deployment workflow..."

# Trigger workflow
gh workflow run "$PROD_WORKFLOW" \
  --ref "$CURRENT_BRANCH" \
  --field feature="$(yq eval '.feature.slug' "$STATE_FILE")" \
  --field deployment_type="production"

# Wait for workflow to start (give GitHub a few seconds)
echo "⏳ Waiting for workflow to start..."
sleep 5

# Find the workflow run
PROD_RUN=$(gh run list \
  --workflow="$PROD_WORKFLOW" \
  --branch="$CURRENT_BRANCH" \
  --limit=1 \
  --json databaseId,status,conclusion \
  --jq '.[0].databaseId')

if [ -z "$PROD_RUN" ]; then
  echo "❌ Could not find workflow run"
  echo "Check GitHub Actions manually: gh run list"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Workflow started: Run ID $PROD_RUN"
echo ""
echo "📊 View workflow: gh run view $PROD_RUN --web"
echo ""
```

**Actions**:
1. Detect production workflow file
2. **Fail fast** if uncommitted changes (non-interactive)
3. Push to remote if needed
4. Trigger GitHub Actions workflow
5. Record run ID for monitoring

**Changes from v1.x**:
- ✅ Removed interactive `read -p "Commit changes?"` prompt
- ✅ Fail fast with actionable error messages
- ✅ CI-safe (no human intervention required)

---

## Phase DP.3: Monitor Deployment

**Purpose**: Wait for production deployment to complete and monitor progress

```bash
echo "⏳ Phase DP.3: Monitor Production Deployment"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""

# Watch workflow run
gh run watch "$PROD_RUN" --exit-status || {
  echo ""
  echo "❌ Production deployment FAILED"
  echo ""
  echo "View logs: gh run view $PROD_RUN --log"
  echo ""

  # Update state
  update_workflow_phase "$FEATURE_DIR" "ship:deploy-prod" "failed"

  # Save failure information
  cat > "$FEATURE_DIR/deploy-prod-failure.md" <<EOF
# Production Deployment Failure

**Run ID**: $PROD_RUN
**Timestamp**: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
**Branch**: $CURRENT_BRANCH

## View Logs

\`\`\`bash
gh run view $PROD_RUN --log
\`\`\`

## Retry Deployment

After fixing the issue, retry with:

\`\`\`bash
/ship continue
\`\`\`

## Manual Rollback (Platform-Specific)

If the deployment partially succeeded and broke production:

### Vercel Rollback

1. **Find previous deployment ID**:
   \`\`\`bash
   vercel ls --token=\$VERCEL_TOKEN
   \`\`\`

2. **Alias previous deployment to production URL**:
   \`\`\`bash
   vercel alias set <previous-deployment-id> <production-url> --token=\$VERCEL_TOKEN
   # Example: vercel alias set app-abc123.vercel.app myapp.com --token=\$VERCEL_TOKEN
   \`\`\`

### Railway Rollback

1. Go to Railway dashboard: https://railway.app
2. Select your project
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Select previous successful deployment
5. Click "Redeploy" button

### Netlify Rollback

1. **Find previous deployment ID**:
   \`\`\`bash
   netlify sites:list
   netlify deploys:list --site=<site-id>
   \`\`\`

2. **Restore previous deployment**:
   \`\`\`bash
   netlify deploy:restore <previous-deploy-id> --site=<site-id>
   \`\`\`

### Git-Based Rollback (Universal)

\`\`\`bash
# Revert the git commit (safe, creates new commit)
git revert $(git rev-parse HEAD)
git push

# OR reset to previous commit (destructive, rewrites history)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push --force
\`\`\`

## Debug Workflow

\`\`\`bash
# View full workflow output
gh run view $PROD_RUN --log > production-deploy-logs.txt

# Check workflow configuration
cat .github/workflows/$PROD_WORKFLOW

# Verify environment secrets
gh secret list

# Check environment variables in GitHub Actions
gh variable list
\`\`\`
EOF

  echo "💾 Failure report saved: $FEATURE_DIR/deploy-prod-failure.md"
  exit 1
}

echo ""
echo "✅ Production deployment workflow completed successfully"
echo ""
```

**Monitoring**:
- Live output from GitHub Actions
- Automatic failure detection
- Failure report generation with platform-specific rollback instructions
- Exit on deployment failure

**Changes from v1.x**:
- ✅ Added concrete Vercel rollback commands
- ✅ Added concrete Railway rollback steps
- ✅ Added concrete Netlify rollback commands
- ✅ Added git-based universal rollback

---

## Phase DP.4: Extract Deployment IDs

**Purpose**: Extract deployment IDs from workflow logs for rollback capability

```bash
echo "🔍 Phase DP.4: Extract Deployment IDs"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"

fi
```

**Extracted Information**:
- Vercel deployment URLs (marketing, app)
- Docker image references (API)
- Railway deployment IDs
- Netlify deployment IDs
- Git commit SHA
- GitHub Actions run ID

**Storage**:
- `deployment-metadata.json` - Human-readable metadata
- `workflow-state.yaml` - Machine-readable state for rollback

## Phase DP.5: Verify Production Health

**Purpose**: Basic health checks on production deployment

```bash
echo "🏥 Phase DP.5: Production Health Checks"
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""

# Try to determine production URL from deployment IDs or workflow logs
PROD_URL=""

if [ -n "$APP_ID" ]; then

else
  # Try to extract from workflow logs
  PROD_URL=$(echo "$DEPLOY_LOGS" | grep -oE "https://[a-z0-9-]+\.(vercel\.app|netlify\.app|railway\.app)" | head -1)
fi

if [ -z "$PROD_URL" ]; then

  if [ "$HTTP_STATUS" = "200" ] || [ "$HTTP_STATUS" = "304" ]; then
    echo "✅ Production site is accessible (HTTP $HTTP_STATUS)"
  elif [ "$HTTP_STATUS" = "000" ]; then
    echo "⚠️  Could not reach production site (connection failed)"
    echo "   This may be due to DNS propagation delay"
  else
    echo "⚠️  Production site returned HTTP $HTTP_STATUS"
    echo "   Manual verification recommended"
  fi

  echo ""

  # Check for errors in browser console (if we can parse HTML)
  echo "Checking for JavaScript errors..."

  HTML_CONTENT=$(curl -s "$PROD_URL" || echo "")

  if echo "$HTML_CONTENT" | grep -qi "error"; then
    echo "⚠️  Potential errors detected in page content"
    echo "   Manual verification recommended"
  else
    echo "✅ No obvious errors in page content"
  fi

  echo ""
fi

# Store health check results
HEALTH_PASSED=true
[ "$HTTP_STATUS" = "200" ] || [ "$HTTP_STATUS" = "304" ] || HEALTH_PASSED=false

cat > "$FEATURE_DIR/production-health-check.json" <<EOF
{
  "timestamp": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)",
  "url": "${PROD_URL:-unknown}",
  "http_status": "${HTTP_STATUS:-unknown}",
  "passed": $HEALTH_PASSED
}
EOF

echo "💾 Health check results: $FEATURE_DIR/production-health-check.json"
echo ""
```

**Health Checks**:
- HTTP status code verification
- DNS propagation wait
- Basic content validation
- Error detection in HTML

**Non-Blocking**: Health check failures don't stop deployment (production is already live)

## Rollback Instructions

If issues arise, rollback using the deployment IDs above.

### Vercel Rollback

\`\`\`bash
# Find previous deployments
vercel ls --token=\$VERCEL_TOKEN

# Rollback app to previous deployment
vercel alias set <previous-deployment-id> <production-url> --token=\$VERCEL_TOKEN

# Example:
# vercel alias set app-abc123.vercel.app myapp.com --token=\$VERCEL_TOKEN
\`\`\`

### Railway Rollback

1. Go to Railway dashboard: https://railway.app
2. Select your project
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Select previous successful deployment
5. Click "Redeploy" button

### Netlify Rollback

\`\`\`bash
# Find previous deployments
netlify sites:list
netlify deploys:list --site=<site-id>

# Restore previous deployment
netlify deploy:restore <previous-deploy-id> --site=<site-id>
\`\`\`

### Git-Based Rollback (Universal)

\`\`\`bash
# Revert the git commit (safe, creates new commit)
git revert $(git rev-parse HEAD)
git push

# OR reset to previous commit (destructive, rewrites history)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push --force
\`\`\`

- Production URL
- Deployment IDs for rollback
- Health check results
- **Platform-specific rollback instructions** (Vercel, Railway, Netlify, Git)
- Post-deployment task checklist
- Links to all artifacts

**State Updates**:
- Mark `ship:deploy-prod` as completed
- Store production URL
- Record deployment timestamp

**Changes from v1.x**:
- ✅ Added concrete Vercel rollback commands with examples
- ✅ Added step-by-step Railway rollback instructions
- ✅ Added Netlify rollback commands
- ✅ Added git-based universal rollback
- ✅ Fixed typo on line 669 (`n#` → `#`)

## Error Recovery

**Common Failures**:

1. **Workflow not found**
   ```bash
   # Check workflow files
   ls -la .github/workflows/
   # Look for deploy-production.yml or deploy.yml
   ```

2. **Deployment failed**
   ```bash
   # View logs
   gh run view <run-id> --log
   # Check for:
   # - Missing environment variables
   # - Build failures
   # - Deployment platform errors
   ```

3. **Health check failed**
   ```bash
   # Manual check
   curl -I <production-url>
   # Check DNS
   dig <your-domain>
   # Wait for DNS propagation (can take 5-30 minutes)
   ```

4. **Rollback IDs missing**
   ```bash
   # Manual extraction from logs
   gh run view <run-id> --log > deploy-logs.txt
   grep -E "vercel|railway|netlify" deploy-logs.txt
   ```

**Recovery Steps**:
- Fix the issue causing failure
- Run `/ship continue` to retry
- If production is broken, use platform-specific rollback instructions from the failure report
- Check workflow logs for detailed error messages

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Pre-deployment checks passed
- ✅ Production workflow triggered successfully
- ✅ Deployment completed without errors
- ✅ Deployment IDs extracted (or manual rollback documented)
- ✅ Production health check passed (or manual verification noted)
- ✅ Production report generated
- ✅ State updated to completed

---

## Notes

- **No staging validation**: This deployment goes straight to production
- **Risk level**: Higher than staging-prod model
- **Best for**: Simple applications, solo developers, rapid iteration
- **Rollback**: Critical to extract and store deployment IDs
- **Monitoring**: Manual monitoring more important without staging gate
- **Recovery**: Platform-specific rollback procedures documented in failure report

This command is automatically called by `/ship` when deployment model is `direct-prod`.
