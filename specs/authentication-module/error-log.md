## Known Issues

### Issue: robin-stocks Unofficial API
**Status**: Acknowledged
**Impact**: Medium (Robinhood may change API without notice)
**Mitigation**:
- Pin robin-stocks version (3.0.5)
- Monitor library for updates
- Comprehensive error handling
- Session caching to reduce API calls

### Issue: Pickle Security
**Status**: Mitigated
**Impact**: Low (local file system only)
**Mitigation**:
- File permissions set to 600 (owner-only)
- .robinhood.pickle in .gitignore
- No network exposure
- Corrupt pickle detection and auto-cleanup

### Issue: MFA Secret Exposure Risk
**Status**: Mitigated
**Impact**: Critical if exposed
**Mitigation**:
- MFA secret never logged
- .env file in .gitignore
- Input validation prevents injection
- Security audit via bandit scan
