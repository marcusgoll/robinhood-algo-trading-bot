# Specification Quality Checklist: Backtesting Engine

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: specs/001-backtesting-engine/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items passed. Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

Key strengths:
- Clear user scenarios with acceptance criteria
- Well-prioritized user stories (P1-P3 with MVP focus)
- Comprehensive requirements (18 functional, 10 non-functional)
- Detailed key entities with full attribute definitions
- Constitution compliance explicitly verified
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Out of scope section prevents scope creep

No clarifications needed - reasonable assumptions documented for:
- Data source (Alpaca primary, Yahoo Finance fallback)
- Fill simulation (next bar open price)
- Strategy interface (to be defined in planning)
- Commission model (configurable, default $0 for Robinhood)
