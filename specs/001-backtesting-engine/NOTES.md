# Feature: Backtesting Engine

## Overview
Implementation of a comprehensive backtesting engine to validate trading strategies against historical market data before deployment to paper or live trading. This critical safety feature enables strategy validation and performance analysis without risking capital.

## Research Findings

### Constitution Compliance
From `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:
- **Â§Testing_Requirements**: "Backtesting - Strategy validation against historical data" is explicitly required
- **Â§Safety_First**: "Never trade with real money until fully tested" - backtesting is the validation gate
- **Â§Code_Quality**: Must maintain 90% test coverage, type hints required
- **Â§Risk_Management**: Backtesting validates stop losses, position sizing, and risk controls
- **Â§Data_Integrity**: Must handle missing data, validate timestamps (UTC), ensure data completeness

### Existing Project Structure
From codebase analysis:
- Project uses Python 3.11+ with `robin_stocks` library
- Type checking with `mypy`, testing with `pytest`
- Configuration in `config.json` for trading parameters
- Existing modules: market_data, order_management, performance tracking, risk management
- No existing backtest module found - this is net new capability

### Similar Features
From roadmap and specs:
- `002-momentum-detection`: Backend trading logic, similar testing requirements
- `performance tracking`: Existing module for trade analysis that can be leveraged
- Template available: `.spec-flow/templates/backtest-report-template.md` for output format

### Key Decisions Required
1. Historical data source: Use existing market_data module or dedicated backtest data provider?
2. Execution model: Event-driven simulation or vectorized backtesting?
3. Slippage/commission modeling: Simple fixed cost or realistic market impact?
4. Output format: JSON, CSV, or rich HTML reports?
5. Strategy interface: How do strategies plug into backtest engine?

## System Components Analysis
Backend-only feature - no UI components.

Potential reuse from existing codebase:
- `src/trading_bot/market_data/`: Market data fetching and validation
- `src/trading_bot/performance/`: Performance tracking and metrics
- `src/trading_bot/order_management/`: Order execution logic (can be simulated)
- `src/trading_bot/risk_management/`: Risk controls to validate in backtest

New components needed:
- Backtest engine core
- Historical data manager
- Simulated broker/executor
- Performance analyzer
- Backtest report generator

## Feature Classification
- UI screens: false (backend-only)
- Improvement: false (new capability)
- Measurable: false (internal tooling, not user-facing metrics)
- Deployment impact: false (no infrastructure changes, new Python module only)

## Checkpoints
- Phase 0 (Specification): 2025-10-19
- Phase 1 (Planning): 2025-10-19

## Phase Summaries

### Phase 1: Planning
- Research depth: 150 lines (6 key decisions documented)
- Key decisions: Event-driven execution, Alpaca+Yahoo data sources, Protocol interface, next-bar-open fills, file-based reports, disk caching
- Components to reuse: 7 (market data service, validators, performance models, retry, auth, logging, data models)
- New components: 5 (engine, historical data manager, strategy protocol, performance calculator, report generator)
- Migration needed: No

**Artifacts Generated**:
- research.md: Research decisions + component reuse analysis
- data-model.md: 5 entity definitions + ER diagram + validation rules
- quickstart.md: 6 integration scenarios (setup, run, custom strategy, validation, comparison, manual tests)
- plan.md: Consolidated architecture + 7-phase implementation roadmap
- contracts/api.yaml: Python API schemas (OpenAPI format)
- error-log.md: Initialized for error tracking
