## Quality Analysis

### Constitution Alignment

✅ All constitution MUST principles addressed:

- **§Safety_First**: Backtesting validates strategies before live deployment (FR-001 through FR-018)
- **§Code_Quality**: Type hints required (plan.md), ≥90% test coverage (NFR-007, T085), single-purpose functions (plan.md architecture)
- **§Risk_Management**: Risk validation deferred to US7 (P2), but architecture supports it
- **§Security**: API keys in environment variables only (NFR-008, T016)
- **§Data_Integrity**: UTC timestamps (NFR-005), data validation (FR-002), split/dividend adjustments (FR-003)
- **§Testing_Requirements**: This IS the backtesting requirement - comprehensive test suite with acceptance tests

### Architectural Consistency

✅ Plan-to-Spec alignment verified:

- All entities from spec.md defined in data-model.md
- All functional requirements have corresponding implementation tasks
- Architecture decisions (event-driven, protocol-based) align with spec requirements
- Technology stack (Python 3.11+, Alpaca, Yahoo Finance) consistent across artifacts

### Terminology Consistency

✅ Key terms used consistently:

- BacktestEngine: Consistently referenced in plan.md and tasks.md
- HistoricalDataManager: Consistent usage for data fetching/caching
- IStrategy: Protocol name used consistently throughout
- PerformanceCalculator: Consistent naming for metrics calculation
- ReportGenerator: Consistent naming for report generation

### TDD Compliance

✅ Test-Driven Development approach verified:

- Every implementation task has preceding test tasks
- Acceptance criteria defined for each user story
- NFR validation tests explicitly defined (T070-T073)
- Test coverage validation included in quality gates (T085)

### Data Model Completeness

✅ All required entities defined:

- BacktestConfig: Configuration parameters
- HistoricalDataBar: OHLCV data structure
- Trade: Individual trade record
- PerformanceMetrics: Calculated statistics
- BacktestResult: Complete output structure
- Position: Open position tracking
- BacktestState: Execution state management

## Risk Analysis

### Identified Risks (From plan.md)

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Status |
|------|----------|------------|--------|
| Alpaca API rate limits | LOW | Aggressive caching, Yahoo Finance fallback | ✅ Addressed in T015, T017 |
| Look-ahead bias | CRITICAL | Event-driven execution, chronological iteration, tests | ✅ Addressed in T021, T027 |
| Float precision errors | MEDIUM | Decimal type for monetary calculations | ✅ Addressed in plan.md architecture |
| Performance not meeting 30s target | LOW | Pandas vectorization, profiling | ✅ Acceptance test T070 validates |
| Strategy protocol violations | MEDIUM | Runtime protocol checking, examples | ✅ Addressed in T020, T025, T026 |
| Historical data quality issues | MEDIUM | Comprehensive validation, warnings | ✅ Addressed in T012, T082 |

All identified risks have explicit mitigation strategies and corresponding implementation tasks.

## Next Actions

**✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

Next: `/implement`

### Implementation will:

1. Execute 61 tasks from tasks.md in phases
2. Follow TDD approach (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR where applicable)
3. Reference existing patterns for consistency
4. Commit after each completed task
5. Track issues in error-log.md
6. Achieve ≥90% test coverage (constitution requirement)

### Estimated Duration

Based on task complexity:
- Phase 1-2 (Setup & Foundation): 4-6 hours
- Phase 3-6 (MVP User Stories): 18-32 hours (US1: 4-8h, US2: 8-16h, US3: 4-8h, US4: 2-4h)
- Phase 7-8 (Integration & Polish): 6-10 hours

**Total: 28-48 hours** (3.5-6 days for single developer)

Parallelization opportunities can reduce to 2-3 days with team.
