# Error Log: Telegram Command Handlers for Bot Control and Reporting

## Planning Phase (Phase 0-2)

No errors encountered during planning phase.

All technical decisions resolved:
- Research complete (6 decisions documented in research.md)
- Architecture designed (plan.md)
- Data model defined (data-model.md - stateless)
- API contracts specified (contracts/api.yaml)
- Integration scenarios documented (quickstart.md)

**Key Risk Identified**:
- Control endpoints (POST /pause, POST /resume) missing from Feature #029 API
- Mitigation: Add api/app/routes/commands.py before task execution phase
- Impact: Blocking for /pause and /resume commands (will be addressed in tasks phase)
