# Specification Quality Checklist: Telegram Command Handlers

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: specs/031-telegram-command-handlers/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED (16/16 checks complete)

**Details**:
- CHK001: Specification describes WHAT (commands, responses, data) not HOW (classes, functions, libraries)
- CHK002: Focuses on user value (remote control, mobile workflow, instant status checks)
- CHK003: Language is accessible to product owners and stakeholders
- CHK004: All sections present (Overview, Problem, Scenarios, FR/NFR, Success Criteria, Dependencies, Deployment)
- CHK005: Zero clarification markers - all decisions made with reasonable defaults
- CHK006: Each requirement is testable (e.g., "responds within 3 seconds", "rejects unauthorized users")
- CHK007: Success criteria include measurable targets (95% within 3s, 100% auth rejection, 1 cmd/5s limit)
- CHK008: Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of specific libraries or implementation)
- CHK009: 8 user scenarios cover happy path, error cases, security, and edge cases
- CHK010: Edge cases identified (unauthorized access, rate limiting, API failures, unknown commands)
- CHK011: Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries (no order placement, no config changes, no NLP)
- CHK012: Dependencies and Assumptions sections document all external requirements
- CHK013: All 15 functional requirements have measurable acceptance criteria
- CHK014: User scenarios cover authentication, control, querying, error handling, and help
- CHK015: Success criteria directly map to user scenarios and functional requirements
- CHK016: No implementation details (no mention of python-telegram-bot framework, httpx, or specific classes)

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. No blocking issues identified.

Key strengths:
- Clear integration with existing features (#029 and #030)
- Comprehensive security considerations (auth, rate limiting, audit logging)
- Mobile-first UX design (emoji, markdown, concise responses)
- Graceful error handling specified
- Well-defined API integration strategy

Ready to proceed with `/plan` command.
