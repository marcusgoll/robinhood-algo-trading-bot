# Specification Quality Checklist: sentiment-analysis-integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: specs/034-sentiment-analysis-integration/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focuses on outcomes: win rate, latency, coverage)
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined (4 scenarios + edge cases)
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified (API failures, rate limits, model loading errors)
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded (MVP: US1-US3, Enhancement: US4-US5)
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified (6 assumptions documented)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (FR-001 to FR-010)
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows (social media fetch → sentiment analysis → signal aggregation)
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (HEART metrics with log-based measurement)
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification (tech stack mentioned for context only)

## Notes

- All checklist items passed
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all requirements clear and testable)
- Specification ready for `/plan` phase
- Feature classification: Improvement + Measurable + Deployment Impact (no UI)
