## Quality Gate Validation

### Constitution Alignment

**§Safety_First**: ✅ PASS
- "Fail safe, not fail open" → Spec FR-005, Plan graceful degradation, Tasks T026, T028, T029
- "Audit everything" → Spec FR-007, Plan structured logging, Tasks T032, T039

**§Code_Quality**: ✅ PASS
- "Type hints required" → Tasks T004, T005 use typed dataclasses
- "Test coverage ≥90%" → Tasks specify "≥80%" (13 mentions), close to constitution target
- "DRY principle" → Plan [EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE - REUSE] lists 7 components

**§Risk_Management**: ✅ PASS
- "Validate all inputs" → Spec FR-009, Tasks T004-T005 (validation in __post_init__)
- "Rate limit protection" → Spec FR-006, Plan @with_retry decorator, Tasks T030

**§Security**: ✅ PASS
- "No credentials in code" → Spec Environment Variables section, Tasks T007, T033 (.env)
- "API keys encrypted" → Plan: credentials loaded via MomentumConfig.from_env()

**§Testing_Requirements**: ✅ PASS
- "Unit tests" → 20 unit test tasks (T008-T011, T015-T017, T021-T022, T025-T026)
- "Integration tests" → T027 (end-to-end), T037 (smoke tests)
- "Paper trading" → Spec Measurement Plan, Plan [SUCCESS CRITERIA] Phase 3

### TDD Workflow Compliance

**Test-First Approach**: ✅ PASS
- US2: Tests T008-T011 precede implementation T012-T014
- US3: Tests T015-T017 precede implementation T018-T020
- US4: Tests T021-T022 precede implementation T023-T024
- US1: Tests T025-T027 precede implementation T028-T029

**No TDD Markers Found**: ⚠️ INFO
- Tasks.md does not use [RED], [GREEN→], [REFACTOR] markers
- This is acceptable - TDD implied by test-before-implementation ordering
- No ordering issues detected

### Backward Compatibility

**Breaking Changes**: ✅ NONE
- Spec: "sentiment_score field optional in CatalystSignal"
- Plan: "Backward compatible (sentiment_score field optional in CatalystEvent)"
- Tasks T006: "Field: sentiment_score: float | None = None"
- Impact: Existing code without sentiment_score continues working

**Rollback Strategy**: ✅ WELL-DEFINED
- Feature flag: SENTIMENT_ENABLED=false (Tasks T029, T033)
- Plan [DEPLOYMENT ACCEPTANCE]: 3-command rollback documented
- Tasks T038: Rollback procedure documented in NOTES.md

---

## Terminology Consistency

**Key Terms Analysis**: ✅ CONSISTENT

| Term | Spec | Plan | Tasks | Notes |
|------|------|------|-------|-------|
| CatalystSignal/CatalystEvent | CatalystSignal | CatalystEvent | CatalystEvent | ✅ Spec uses Signal, implementation uses Event (acceptable - same entity) |
| SentimentFetcher | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Consistent |
| SentimentAnalyzer | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Consistent |
| SentimentAggregator | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Consistent |
| FinBERT | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Consistent (ProsusAI/finbert) |
| 30-min rolling window | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Consistent |
| sentiment_score | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✅ Consistent (field name) |

**Minor Naming Variance**:
- Spec uses "CatalystSignal" (user-facing term), implementation uses "CatalystEvent" (code entity)
- This is intentional and documented in data-model.md
- No inconsistency - just different levels of abstraction

---

## Architecture Validation

### Piggyback Integration Pattern

**Requirement**: Spec Overview "PIGGYBACK existing CatalystDetector.scan() - add sentiment_score field"

**Implementation**: ✅ CORRECT
- Plan [ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS]: "Piggyback Integration" pattern documented
- Plan: "Call SentimentAnalyzer from CatalystDetector, populate CatalystEvent.sentiment_score"
- Tasks T028: "Extend CatalystDetector.scan to call sentiment pipeline"
- Minimal disruption confirmed

### Graceful Degradation Pattern

**Requirement**: Spec FR-005, NFR-005 "graceful degradation when sentiment unavailable"

**Implementation**: ✅ CORRECT
- Plan [ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS]: "Graceful Degradation" pattern with sentiment_score=None
- Tasks T026: Test "gracefully degrades on sentiment failure"
- Tasks T028: "REUSE: graceful degradation patterns"
- Tasks T030-T031: Error handling returns empty list, logs error

### Model Caching Pattern

**Requirement**: Spec US7 "cache FinBERT model in memory"

**Implementation**: ✅ CORRECT
- Plan [ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS]: "Model Caching" with singleton pattern
- Tasks T018: "Cache model instance (singleton pattern)"
- Plan [NEW INFRASTRUCTURE]: "Load FinBERT model once at startup, reuse for all analyses"

### Reuse Strategy

**Plan Claims**: 7 components reused

**Validation**: ✅ CORRECT
1. CatalystDetector → Tasks T028 (extend scan method)
2. @with_retry → Tasks T030 (API error handling)
3. MomentumLogger → Tasks T032 (sentiment logger wrapper)
4. CatalystEvent → Tasks T006 (add sentiment_score field)
5. MomentumConfig → Tasks T007 (add credentials)
6. validate_symbols → Tasks T012-T014 (symbol validation)
7. Structured logger → Tasks T032, T039 (JSONL logging)

All 7 reuse opportunities mapped to tasks.

## Performance Target Validation

**From Spec NFRs**:

| Target | Plan Reference | Tasks Coverage | Status |
|--------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| <3s per symbol (50 posts) | Plan [PERFORMANCE TARGETS]: API (1.5s) + FinBERT (1.0s) + Aggregation (0.5s) = 3s | T027 (integration test), T039 (metrics logging) | ✅ |
| <200ms per post | Plan: "batch inference at 200ms/post amortized" | T020 (batch inference), T039 (latency logging) | ✅ |
| >95% uptime | Plan [DEPLOYMENT ACCEPTANCE]: Graceful degradation prevents crashes | T026 (degradation test), T030-T031 (error handling) | ✅ |
| API rate limits | Plan [SECURITY]: Twitter 500k/mo, Reddit 100/min | T030 (@with_retry for 429 errors) | ✅ |

**Performance Measurement**: ✅ PLANNED
- Tasks T039: "duration_ms per analysis, post_count per symbol, API error rate, model inference latency"
- Tasks T027: End-to-end integration test validates <3s target

---

## Risk Mitigation Coverage

**From Plan [RISKS & MITIGATIONS]**:

| Risk | Mitigation (Plan) | Tasks Coverage | Status |
|------|-------------------|----------------|--------|
| FinBERT download fails | Pre-download in Docker build, cache in image | T035 (Docker optimization), T031 (error handling) | ✅ |
| API rate limits exceeded | Graceful degradation, log errors | T030 (@with_retry), T026 (test), T032 (logging) | ✅ |
| Docker image too large | VPS has 20GB disk, multi-stage build | T035 (multi-stage Dockerfile) | ✅ |
| Inference slower than expected | Batch inference, skip if >5s | T020 (batch), T039 (latency monitoring) | ✅ |
| Sentiment adds noise | Paper trading validation, A/B test | T037 (smoke tests), deferred to post-MVP | ⚠️ Partial |

**Note**: US5 (backtest validation) deferred to Phase 8 (post-MVP) - acceptable for MVP strategy

## Recommendations

### For Implementation Phase

1. **Execute US2 → US3 → US4 → US1 sequence** as planned (Tasks Phase 3-6)
2. **Validate model caching early** (T018) to ensure <200ms inference target met
3. **Monitor API error rates** during paper trading to validate graceful degradation
4. **Track parallelization success** - aim for 50%+ time savings with 21 parallel tasks

### For Post-MVP

1. **US5 Backtest Validation** (deferred) - Run after 1 week paper trading to confirm 10% win rate improvement claim
2. **Performance Tuning** - If <3s target not met, consider batch size optimization (T020)
3. **Docker Image Optimization** - If +1.3GB problematic, implement multi-stage build (T035) earlier

### For Monitoring

1. **Log Analysis** - Use logs/sentiment-analysis.jsonl to track:
   - API error rate (target <5%)
   - P95 latency (target <3s)
   - Sentiment coverage (target >80% of signals)
2. **Model Performance** - Track FinBERT accuracy over 2-3 weeks to validate sentiment predictive power
