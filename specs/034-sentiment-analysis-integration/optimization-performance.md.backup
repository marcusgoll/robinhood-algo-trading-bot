# Performance Validation Report

**Feature**: Sentiment Analysis Integration (034-sentiment-analysis-integration)
**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Validation Type**: Backend Performance Testing

## Executive Summary

**Status**: SKIPPED (No real performance tests available)

Performance tests exist but are mocked and do not provide real-world performance measurements. The feature requires integration testing with actual FinBERT model inference to validate performance targets.

## Performance Targets (from plan.md)

### NFR-001: Total Sentiment Analysis Time
- **Target**: <3s per symbol (50 posts)
- **Breakdown**:
  - API fetch (Twitter + Reddit): ~1.5s (parallel requests)
  - FinBERT inference (50 posts): ~1.0s (batch inference)
  - Aggregation: ~0.5s (weighted average calculation)
- **Actual**: NOT MEASURED (mocked tests only)
- **Result**: SKIPPED

### NFR-004: FinBERT Inference Performance
- **Target**: <200ms per post (amortized via batch inference)
- **Expected**: 50 posts in ~10s total (200ms/post)
- **Actual**: NOT MEASURED (mocked tests only)
- **Result**: SKIPPED

## Test Execution Summary

### Tests Found
- **Location**: `tests/unit/services/momentum/sentiment/`
- **Performance Test**: `test_analyze_batch_performance_under_200ms_per_post`
- **Status**: PASSED (but mocked, no real timing data)

### Test Results
```
Total Tests: 16 tests
Passed: 16/16 (100%)
Failed: 0
Duration: 5.26 seconds (entire test suite, not performance measurement)
```

#### Test Breakdown
1. **SentimentAnalyzer Tests**: 7 tests
   - Model loading: PASSED
   - Sentiment scoring: PASSED
   - Batch processing: PASSED
   - Performance test: PASSED (mocked)

2. **SentimentFetcher Tests**: 9 tests
   - Twitter API: PASSED
   - Reddit API: PASSED
   - Combined fetching: PASSED
   - Error handling: PASSED

## Issues Found

### Critical Issues
None (tests pass, but no real performance data)

### Performance Concerns
1. **No Real-World Performance Data**: All tests use mocked APIs and models
   - FinBERT model inference not measured
   - API fetch times not measured
   - End-to-end analysis time not measured

2. **Missing Integration Tests**: No integration tests found at `tests/integration/momentum/sentiment/`
   - Only `__init__.py` exists
   - No end-to-end performance tests

### Recommendations
1. **Create Integration Performance Tests**:
   - Load actual FinBERT model
   - Measure real inference time for 50 posts
   - Test with real Twitter/Reddit API (or recorded responses)
   - Validate <3s total time target

2. **Add Performance Benchmarks**:
   - Use pytest-benchmark for accurate timing
   - Measure P50, P95, P99 latencies
   - Test under different loads (10, 50, 100 posts)

3. **Staging Validation Required**:
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Run real sentiment analysis on test symbols
   - Monitor logs/sentiment-analysis.jsonl for actual timing data
   - Verify NFR-001 and NFR-004 targets in production-like environment

## Frontend Performance

**Status**: NOT APPLICABLE (backend-only feature per plan.md)

- No Lighthouse checks required
- No bundle size analysis required
- No UI/UX performance testing required

## Performance Metrics Summary

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Total analysis time (50 posts) | <3s | Not measured | SKIPPED |
| FinBERT inference per post | <200ms | Not measured | SKIPPED |
| API fetch time (Twitter + Reddit) | ~1.5s | Not measured | SKIPPED |
| Aggregation time | ~0.5s | Not measured | SKIPPED |
| Model load time (startup) | Not specified | Not measured | SKIPPED |

## Conclusions

### Performance Status: SKIPPED

The feature has unit tests in place and they all pass, but they are fully mocked and do not provide real performance measurements. To validate the performance targets (NFR-001: <3s per symbol, NFR-004: <200ms per post), the following is required:

1. **Integration tests** with actual FinBERT model inference
2. **Staging deployment** with real-world performance monitoring
3. **Performance benchmarking** with pytest-benchmark or similar tools

### Next Steps for Performance Validation

1. **Pre-Staging**:
   - Create integration tests with real model
   - Add timing instrumentation to production code
   - Implement structured logging of performance metrics

2. **Staging Validation**:
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Run sentiment analysis on 5-10 test symbols
   - Monitor logs/sentiment-analysis.jsonl for:
     - `sentiment.model_loaded` (load_duration_ms)
     - `sentiment.analysis_completed` (duration_ms)
   - Extract and validate against targets

3. **Performance Optimization** (if needed):
   - Profile slow components
   - Optimize batch sizes
   - Consider GPU acceleration for FinBERT
   - Implement caching strategies

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM

- Tests pass but don't measure real performance
- Unknown if <3s target is achievable with real model
- No baseline performance data available
- May require optimization after staging deployment

### Approval Status

Performance validation cannot be completed until:
- [ ] Integration tests with real FinBERT model are created
- [ ] Staging deployment with performance monitoring is completed
- [ ] Actual timing data confirms NFR-001 (<3s) and NFR-004 (<200ms) targets

**Recommendation**: Proceed to staging with enhanced logging, monitor performance, iterate if needed.

### Performance Test Details

**Test**: `test_analyze_batch_performance_under_200ms_per_post`
- **Location**: `tests/unit/services/momentum/sentiment/test_sentiment_analyzer.py:217`
- **Purpose**: Validate batch inference meets <200ms per post target
- **Implementation**: Mocked FinBERT model with timing check
- **Result**: PASSED (mocked execution time < 10s for 50 posts)
- **Limitation**: Does not measure real FinBERT inference performance

**Note**: Test validates the timing check logic but not actual performance.
