# Performance Report

**Feature**: Sentiment Analysis Integration (034-sentiment-analysis-integration)
**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Validation Type**: Backend Performance Testing

---

## Executive Summary

**Status**: SKIPPED (No real performance tests available)

Performance tests exist but are mocked and do not provide real-world performance measurements. The feature requires integration testing with actual FinBERT model inference to validate performance targets.

**Static analysis reveals 2 critical performance risks** that may violate NFR-001 (<3s per symbol) when processing multiple symbols.

---

## Backend Performance

### NFR-001: Total Sentiment Analysis Time
- **Target**: <3s per symbol (50 posts)
- **Breakdown**:
  - API fetch (Twitter + Reddit): ~1.5s (parallel requests)
  - FinBERT inference (50 posts): ~1.0s (batch inference)
  - Aggregation: ~0.5s (weighted average calculation)
- **Actual**: NOT MEASURED (mocked tests only)
- **Result**: SKIPPED - measure in staging

### NFR-004: FinBERT Inference Performance
- **Target**: <200ms per post (amortized via batch inference)
- **Expected**: 50 posts in ~10s total (200ms/post)
- **Actual**: NOT MEASURED (mocked tests only)
- **Result**: SKIPPED - measure in staging

## Static Code Analysis

### Performance Concerns Identified

#### 1. Sequential Processing of Signals (N+1 Pattern) - CRITICAL
**Location**: `src/trading_bot/momentum/catalyst_detector.py:580-648` (`_enrich_with_sentiment`)

**Issue**: The sentiment enrichment processes each signal sequentially in a `for` loop:
```python
for signal in signals:
    posts = self.sentiment_fetcher.fetch_all(symbol, minutes=30)  # Sequential API calls
    sentiment_results = self.sentiment_analyzer.analyze_batch(post_texts)
```

**Performance Impact**:
- If 5 signals are detected, this makes 5 sequential API calls to Twitter/Reddit
- Each call takes ~1.5s, so 5 signals = 7.5s total
- **Violates NFR-001** (<3s per symbol) when multiple symbols have signals

**Recommendation**:
- The method is marked as `async` but doesn't use `asyncio.gather()` for parallel processing
- Should batch all API calls and run them concurrently
- Expected improvement: 5 signals in ~1.5s instead of 7.5s (5x speedup)

**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: PERFORMANCE RISK - May cause timeouts with multiple symbols

---

#### 2. Synchronous API Calls (No Async I/O) - CRITICAL
**Location**: `src/trading_bot/momentum/sentiment/sentiment_fetcher.py:82-243`

**Issue**: Both `fetch_twitter_posts()` and `fetch_reddit_posts()` are synchronous methods:
- Uses `tweepy.Client` (synchronous) instead of async client
- Uses `praw.Reddit` (synchronous) instead of async wrapper
- No `await` or `asyncio` usage despite being called from async context

**Performance Impact**:
- Blocks the event loop during API I/O operations
- Cannot run Twitter and Reddit fetches in parallel
- API fetch time is additive (Twitter 0.8s + Reddit 0.7s = 1.5s) instead of parallel (max 0.8s)

**Recommendation**:
- Convert to async/await using `tweepy.AsyncClient` and `asyncpraw`
- Use `asyncio.gather()` to fetch Twitter and Reddit in parallel
- Expected improvement: ~0.8s per symbol instead of 1.5s (47% faster)

**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: PERFORMANCE RISK - Violates async best practices

---

#### 3. Batch Inference Implementation - GOOD
**Location**: `src/trading_bot/momentum/sentiment/sentiment_analyzer.py:151-236`

**Assessment**: Batch inference is implemented correctly with PyTorch batch processing

**Performance Analysis**: GOOD
- Uses `analyze_batch()` for multiple posts (line 596 in catalyst_detector.py)
- Processes all posts in single forward pass
- GPU acceleration supported (lines 69-71)
- Expected <200ms per post amortized (meets NFR-004)

**Status**: NO ISSUES - Follows best practices

---

#### 4. Model Caching - GOOD
**Location**: `src/trading_bot/momentum/sentiment/sentiment_analyzer.py:43-91`

**Assessment**: Singleton pattern for model loading is implemented correctly

**Performance Analysis**: GOOD
- Class-level cache: `_model`, `_tokenizer`, `_model_loaded` (lines 43-46)
- Loads once on first instantiation, reuses thereafter
- Prevents repeated model downloads/initialization

**Status**: NO ISSUES - Follows best practices

---

### Summary of Static Analysis

**Critical Performance Risks**: 2
1. Sequential signal processing (N+1 pattern)
2. Synchronous API calls blocking event loop

**Implemented Well**: 2
1. Batch inference for FinBERT
2. Model caching with singleton pattern

**Overall Assessment**: Code has good practices for ML inference but poor async patterns for I/O operations. Performance targets may be violated when processing multiple symbols concurrently.

## Frontend Performance

**Status**: NOT APPLICABLE (backend-only feature per plan.md)

- No Lighthouse checks required
- No bundle size analysis required
- No UI/UX performance testing required

## Performance Metrics Summary

| Metric | Target | Actual | Static Analysis |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Total analysis time (50 posts) | <3s | Not measured | RISK: Sequential processing may exceed target |
| FinBERT inference per post | <200ms | Not measured | OK: Batch inference implemented |
| API fetch time (Twitter + Reddit) | ~1.5s | Not measured | RISK: Synchronous, should be parallel (0.8s) |
| Aggregation time | ~0.5s | Not measured | OK: Simple weighted average |
| Model load time (startup) | Not specified | Not measured | OK: Cached singleton pattern |

## Status

**SKIPPED**

## Recommendations

### Pre-Staging
1. **Create Integration Performance Tests**:
   - Load actual FinBERT model
   - Measure real inference time for 50 posts
   - Test with real Twitter/Reddit API (or recorded responses)
   - Validate <3s total time target

2. **Add Performance Benchmarks**:
   - Use pytest-benchmark for accurate timing
   - Measure P50, P95, P99 latencies
   - Test under different loads (10, 50, 100 posts)

3. **Fix Async Patterns** (HIGH PRIORITY):
   - Convert `sentiment_fetcher.py` to async/await
   - Add `asyncio.gather()` to `_enrich_with_sentiment()` for parallel processing
   - This should reduce latency by 50-80% for multiple symbols

### Staging Validation
1. **Deploy to staging environment**
2. **Run sentiment analysis on 5-10 test symbols**
3. **Monitor logs/sentiment-analysis.jsonl** for:
   - `sentiment.model_loaded` (load_duration_ms)
   - `sentiment.analysis_completed` (duration_ms)
4. **Extract and validate against targets**

### Performance Optimization (if needed)
1. Profile slow components
2. Optimize batch sizes
3. Consider GPU acceleration for FinBERT
4. Implement caching strategies

---

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH

- Tests pass but don't measure real performance
- Unknown if <3s target is achievable with real model
- No baseline performance data available
- **2 critical async patterns violations** that will cause performance issues
- May require optimization after staging deployment

---

## Approval Status

Performance validation cannot be completed until:
- [ ] Integration tests with real FinBERT model are created
- [ ] Async patterns are fixed (convert to asyncio)
- [ ] Staging deployment with performance monitoring is completed
- [ ] Actual timing data confirms NFR-001 (<3s) and NFR-004 (<200ms) targets

**Recommendation**: Fix async patterns before staging deployment, then proceed with enhanced logging to monitor performance.
