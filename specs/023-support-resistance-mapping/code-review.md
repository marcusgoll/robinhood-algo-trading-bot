# Code Review: Support/Resistance Zone Mapping

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: specs/023-support-resistance-mapping
**Reviewer**: Senior Code Reviewer Agent
**Files Changed**: 6 implementation files, 3 test files

## Executive Summary

The support/resistance zone mapping feature implementation demonstrates **strong code quality** with comprehensive validation, good test coverage for core models, and adherence to the Decimal precision pattern. However, there are **critical issues that must be fixed before production deployment**, primarily around incomplete MarketDataService integration, type safety violations, and inadequate test coverage for core detection logic.

**Overall Recommendation**: **Needs Fixes** - Address critical issues before ship.

---

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Ship)

### 1. Incomplete OHLCV Data Integration
**File**: `src/trading_bot/support_resistance/zone_detector.py:181-203`
**Issue**: The `_fetch_ohlcv` method is a placeholder that returns empty DataFrame instead of calling MarketDataService.

Impact: Zone detection will NEVER work in production - always returns empty zones list because OHLCV data is never fetched.

Fix: Implement actual MarketDataService integration.

### 2. Type Safety Violations (mypy --strict failures)
**Files**: 
- `src/trading_bot/support_resistance/models.py:94, 157, 230`
- `src/trading_bot/support_resistance/proximity_checker.py:119`

Issue: Missing generic type parameters for dict return types, and potential None passed to non-optional field.

Impact: Type safety violations compromise reliability and maintainability.

### 3. Import Organization (Linting Failures)
**Files**: All module files in `src/trading_bot/support_resistance/`
Issue: 6 linting errors - un-sorted imports, unused import, outdated type annotation syntax.

Fix: Run `ruff check src/trading_bot/support_resistance/ --fix`

### 4. Insufficient Test Coverage (56.25% vs. 80% target)
**Breakdown**:
- models.py: 100% (PASS)
- zone_logger.py: 100% (PASS)
- zone_detector.py: 78.38% (missing main detect_zones logic)
- config.py: 75% (missing validation paths)
- proximity_checker.py: 31.58% (CRITICAL - most logic untested)

Impact: Inadequate confidence in production readiness.

### 5. Hardcoded Volume Placeholders
**File**: `src/trading_bot/support_resistance/zone_detector.py:441-442`
Issue: Volume metrics use dummy values instead of calculating from OHLCV data.

Impact: Zone strength scoring completely broken - always uses dummy values.

---

## Important Improvements (Should Fix)

### 1. Missing Breakout Detection
**From**: spec.md US5, plan.md Phase 7
Issue: Breakout detection methods not implemented.

### 2. Missing Zone Merging Logic
**From**: spec.md FR-009
Issue: `merge_overlapping_zones` method not implemented or called.

### 3. Missing Performance NFR Validation
**From**: spec.md NFR-001, NFR-002
Issue: No performance tests for <3s analysis and <100ms proximity requirements.

### 4. Missing 4-Hour Timeframe Support
**From**: spec.md US4
Issue: Logic doesn't adjust touch thresholds for FOUR_HOUR timeframe.

### 5. Inconsistent Error Handling
**File**: `zone_detector.py:119-136`
Issue: Catches all exceptions without specific handling.

---

## Minor Suggestions (Consider)

1. KISS Violation: Complex clustering logic in `_cluster_swing_points`
2. Missing docstrings for some private methods
3. Magic number: Distance calculation multiplier
4. ProximityAlert distance validation too strict

## Security Audit

### Input Validation
PASS - Comprehensive validation in all dataclasses and methods

### SQL Injection
N/A - No database queries

### Auth/Authorization
N/A - Local-only feature

### Hardcoded Secrets
PASS - No credentials in code

### Error Exposure
PASS - Error messages don't expose internals

## Test Quality Assessment

### Unit Test Coverage (43 tests)
Excellent:
- Models validation (21 tests, 100% coverage)
- ZoneLogger logging (6 tests, 100% coverage)
- Swing detection edge cases (6 tests)

Gaps:
- No tests for detect_zones integration
- No tests for proximity checker logic
- No tests for config validation errors
- No tests for strength score with real volumes

### Contract Test Coverage
