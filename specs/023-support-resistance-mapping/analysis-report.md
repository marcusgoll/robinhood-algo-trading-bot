## Constitution Alignment

All constitution MUST principles from .spec-flow/memory/constitution.md are addressed:

- **Safety_First**: Fail-safe error handling (T040), graceful degradation on missing data (FR-008)
- **Code_Quality**: Type hints via mypy (T044), test coverage >=90% (test guardrails), DRY via reuse (5 existing components), Decimal precision (T003)
- **Risk_Management**: Input validation (price_level > 0, dates, symbols), API rate limiting via @with_retry (T041)
- **Security**: Environment variables for API credentials (reuse existing auth), no new credentials needed
- **Data_Integrity**: UTC timestamps (T003, T005), data validation (__post_init__), graceful handling of missing data (T040)
- **Testing_Requirements**: Unit tests (100% coverage target), integration tests, TDD approach enforced

## Next Actions

**Ready for Implementation**

Next: `/implement`

/implement will:
1. Execute tasks from tasks.md (46 tasks across 9 phases)
2. Follow TDD approach (write tests first per plan.md [TDD APPROACH])
3. Reuse 5 existing components (MarketDataService, BullFlagDetector pattern, StructuredLogger, retry decorator, Decimal precision)
4. Create 3 new components (ZoneDetector service, models dataclasses, ZoneLogger)
5. Implement MVP first (Phase 1-5: US1-US3) then enhancements (Phase 6-8: US4-US6)
6. Run parallel tasks where marked with [P] (20 tasks eligible)
7. Update NOTES.md after each phase completion

Estimated duration: 2-4 hours for MVP (US1-US3), 4-6 hours total

## Cross-Artifact Consistency Validation

### Spec → Plan Alignment

✅ **Architecture Decisions**: Plan correctly identifies Python 3.11+, Decimal precision, pandas/numpy for analysis
✅ **Reuse Analysis**: Plan identifies 5 reuse opportunities matching spec's no-new-dependencies requirement
✅ **New Components**: Plan creates 3 new components (ZoneDetector, models, ZoneLogger) matching spec entities
✅ **No Database Migration**: Both spec and plan confirm in-memory processing, optional JSONL logging
✅ **Performance Targets**: Plan [PERFORMANCE TARGETS] matches spec NFR-001 (<3s) and NFR-002 (<100ms)

### Plan → Tasks Alignment

✅ **Task Coverage**: All 6 user stories mapped to implementation phases (Phase 3-8)
✅ **TDD Approach**: Tasks follow plan's test-first order (tests before implementation for all core logic)
✅ **Reuse Tasks**: Tasks T003, T004, T005 leverage identified reuse patterns (StructuredLogger, MomentumConfig, Decimal)
✅ **Algorithm Implementation**: Tasks T010-T013 implement plan's Zone Detection Algorithm step-by-step
✅ **Integration**: Task T035-T039 implement US6 bull flag integration per plan [INTEGRATION SCENARIOS]

### Spec → Tasks Alignment

✅ **US1 Acceptance**: Tasks T010-T016 cover daily zone identification with 3+ touches, touch count validation
✅ **US2 Acceptance**: Tasks T017-T021 implement strength scoring (base + volume bonus), sorting by score
✅ **US3 Acceptance**: Tasks T022-T025 implement proximity check (2% threshold), direction detection, sorting by distance
✅ **US4 Acceptance**: Tasks T026-T029 add 4-hour timeframe support with 2+ touch threshold
✅ **US5 Acceptance**: Tasks T030-T034 implement breakout detection (1% price + 1.3x volume), zone flip
✅ **US6 Acceptance**: Tasks T035-T039 adjust bull flag targets to 90% of resistance zone when closer than 2:1 R:R

### Functional Requirements Coverage

✅ **FR-002**: Covered by T010-T016 (swing high identification, 3+ touch filtering)
✅ **FR-003**: Covered by T013 (days parameter 30-90, MarketDataService integration)
✅ **FR-004**: Covered by T017-T020 (strength score = touches + volume bonus)

✅ **FR-010**: Covered by T005, T007, T023, T032 (ZoneLogger with JSONL format)

### Non-Functional Requirements Coverage

✅ **NFR-001**: Covered by T043 (performance test for <3s zone analysis)
✅ **NFR-002**: Covered by T043 (performance test for <100ms proximity check)

✅ **NFR-004**: Covered by T040 (error handling with graceful degradation)
✅ **NFR-005**: Covered by T005, T007 (ZoneLogger with JSONL format, daily rotation)
✅ **NFR-006**: Covered by T003 (UTC timestamps), T005 (structured logs), T040 (fail-safe)

### Edge Cases Coverage

✅ **Insufficient data (<30 days)**: Covered by T040 (warning log, empty list, continue operation)
✅ **Sideways choppy markets**: Covered by T010-T013 (requires 3+ touches, volume confirmation)
✅ **Clustered zones (1-2% apart)**: Covered by T011 (merge overlapping zones within 1.5% tolerance)
✅ **Weak vs strong rejections**: Covered by T017-T020 (strength scoring with volume bonus differentiates)

### Terminology Consistency

✅ **Zone/ZoneDetector**: Consistent across spec (Key Entities), plan (components), tasks (file names)
✅ **Support/Resistance**: Consistent terminology, ZoneType enum in all artifacts
✅ **Strength Score**: Same calculation formula in spec (FR-004), plan (algorithm), tasks (T017)
✅ **Proximity Alert**: Consistent entity name and 2% threshold across all artifacts
✅ **Breakout**: Consistent definition (1% price + 1.3x volume) in spec (US5), plan (algorithm), tasks (T030)
