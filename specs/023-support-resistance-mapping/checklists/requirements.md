# Specification Quality Checklist: Support/resistance zone mapping

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: specs/023-support-resistance-mapping/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items passed
- 0 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (clear requirements)
- Feature is backend-only, no UI artifacts needed
- Local-only deployment, no infrastructure changes
- Dependencies clearly identified: technical-indicators module (shipped)
- MVP strategy: US1-US3 first, then US4-US6 based on validation
- Ready to proceed to /plan phase
