## Findings

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|

## Cross-Artifact Consistency

### Spec → Plan Alignment

✅ **Architecture matches requirements**:
- Composition pattern (plan.md) supports FR-014 (IStrategy unchanged)
- StrategyAllocation dataclass (plan.md) implements FR-007/FR-008 (capital tracking)
- OrchestratorResult (plan.md) delivers FR-013 (comparison table)

✅ **Data model complete**:
- All 4 entities defined in both plan.md and data-model.md
- Relationships documented (1:N orchestrator → allocations)

✅ **Performance targets specified**:
- NFR-001 (<2x overhead) → plan.md Phase 6 benchmark
- NFR-002 (O(n) memory) → plan.md memory profiling test

### Plan → Tasks Alignment

✅ **All 7 implementation phases covered**:
- Phase 1 (Setup) → T001-T002
- Phase 2 (Data Models) → T005-T009
- Phase 3 (US1 Execution) → T010-T018
- Phase 4 (US2 Tracking) → T020-T027
- Phase 5 (US3 Limits) → T030-T037
- Phase 6 (Integration) → T040-T045
- Phase 7 (Documentation) → T050-T052

✅ **Test-Driven Development enforced**:
- All implementation tasks have preceding test tasks
- Test tasks reference specific FRs/NFRs/USs

✅ **Reuse strategy followed**:
- 9 components marked REUSE in tasks (BacktestEngine, IStrategy, etc.)
- 6 components marked NEW (StrategyOrchestrator, 3 dataclasses, 2 test modules)

### Terminology Consistency

⚠️ **Minor inconsistencies** (non-blocking):
- "strategy_id" (code) vs "strategy ID" (prose) - Recommend: Use `strategy_id` in code, "strategy ID" in prose
- "orchestrator" (instance) vs "Orchestrator" (ambiguous) - Recommend: Use "StrategyOrchestrator" for class references

---

## Quality Gates Validation

### Core Requirements (Always Required)

- ✅ **Requirements testable**: All FRs have acceptance criteria (Given-When-Then or assertions)
- ✅ **No placeholders**: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION], TODO, or TBD markers found
- ✅ **No implementation details in spec**: Spec focuses on "what", plan covers "how"

### Success Metrics (Conditional)

- ✅ **HEART metrics defined**: spec.md lines 124-139 (5 dimensions with targets)
- ✅ **Measurement queries documented**: spec.md lines 228-272 (bash/pytest commands)
- ✅ **Structured logging planned**: spec.md lines 212-225, plan.md Phase 5

### UI Features (Conditional)

- ✅ **SKIPPED**: Backend-only system (spec.md line 122, 298)

### Deployment Impact (Conditional)

- ✅ **SKIPPED**: Library code, no infrastructure changes (spec.md lines 200-204)

## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks from Plan

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|------------|--------|
| Performance overhead >2x | Low | Profile early (T044), optimize hot paths | ✅ Mitigated (benchmark test planned) |
| Capital allocation bugs | Medium | Extensive unit tests (T030-T032), fuzz testing | ✅ Mitigated (TDD approach) |
| Equity curve aggregation errors | Low | Integration tests with known values (T040-T042) | ✅ Mitigated (validation tests) |
| Scope creep (P2 features) | Medium | Strict P1 adherence (US1-US3 only) | ✅ Mitigated (clear MVP boundary) |
| Test coverage <90% | Low | TDD approach, coverage checks (T044-T045) | ✅ Mitigated (guardrails in place) |

### Additional Risks Identified in Analysis

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| FR-011 conflict detection underspecified | LOW | Logging only for MVP (defer resolution to P2/US4) |
| FR-014 IStrategy compatibility untested | LOW | Add explicit compatibility test (recommend T019) |

## Performance Validation Plan

### Benchmarks (from tasks.md)

1. **T044 - Performance overhead test**:
   - Target: <2x single-strategy baseline
   - Method: `time.perf_counter()` comparison
   - Pass criteria: `orchestrator_runtime / single_runtime < 2.0`

2. **T045 - Memory growth test**:
   - Target: O(n) linear growth
   - Method: `tracemalloc` profiling
   - Pass criteria: `(mem_10 - mem_1) / 9 ≈ (mem_5 - mem_1) / 4`

### Test Guardrails (from tasks.md lines 413-451)

- ✅ Unit tests: <2s each
- ✅ Integration tests: <10s each
- ✅ Full test suite: <6 min total
- ✅ Coverage: 100% new code, ≥90% overall

## Parallelization Analysis

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**23 tasks marked [P]** (64% of total):
- Phase 2: T005, T006, T007 (independent dataclasses) - 3 tasks
- Phase 2: T008, T009 (independent tests) - 2 tasks
- Phase 3: T010, T011, T012 (test cases) - 3 tasks
- Phase 4: T020, T021, T022, T023 (test cases) - 4 tasks
- Phase 5: T030, T031, T032 (test cases) - 3 tasks
- Phase 6: T040, T041, T042 (integration tests) - 3 tasks
- Phase 7: T050, T051 (exports + docs) - 2 tasks

**Critical Path** (sequential dependencies):
- T001 → T005-T009 → T015 → T016 → T017 → T018 → T025 → T026 → T027 → T035 → T036 → T037 → T043 → T052

**Estimated Speedup**: With parallel execution, ~12 hours → ~8 hours (33% reduction)

## Constitution Alignment

**Constitution file**: D:/Coding/Stocks/.spec-flow/memory/constitution.md

✅ **Constitution exists** but contains no MUST principles
- No violations detected (no MUST rules to violate)
- Project relies on spec.md NFRs and plan.md patterns for quality standards

**Implicit Quality Standards Met**:
- ✅ Test coverage ≥90% (NFR-004, plan.md)
- ✅ Type checking strict mode (plan.md architecture)
- ✅ Fail-fast validation (NFR-003)
- ✅ Data integrity (input validation in all dataclasses)

---

## Recommendations

### Critical (Fix Before Implementation)

*None* - All critical requirements satisfied

### High Priority (Recommended)

*None* - Coverage and quality meet standards

### Medium Priority (Consider)

1. **Add task for FR-014 compatibility test** (C2):
   - Suggested: T019 - Test existing strategies work unchanged with orchestrator
   - Rationale: Validates protocol preservation claim (plan.md line 14)

2. **Clarify FR-011 conflict detection scope** (C1):
   - Current: T043 logs conflicts (detection only)
   - Missing: Conflict resolution (deferred to US4/P2)
   - Recommendation: Update FR-011 description to "MUST detect and log conflicts" (resolution out of MVP scope)

### Low Priority (Optional)

1. **Standardize terminology** (T1, T2):
   - Use `strategy_id` in code, "strategy ID" in documentation
   - Use "StrategyOrchestrator" for class, "orchestrator instance" for clarity

2. **Add NFR-002 validation reference** (A1):
   - Link spec.md NFR-002 to plan.md memory profiling section
   - Improves traceability
