phase_summaries:
  spec-flow: "Created specification for strategy orchestration system with 7 user stories covering multi-strategy backtesting (MVP: parallel execution with fixed allocation, independent performance tracking, capital limits). 15 functional requirements, 7 NFRs, 0 clarifications needed."
  clarify: null
  plan: "Designed multi-strategy orchestration using composition pattern. Orchestrator wraps BacktestEngine to coordinate multiple IStrategy instances. Identified 9 reusable components, requiring 6 new components. 7 implementation phases planned with 90% test coverage target."
  tasks: "Created 36 tasks organized by user story: 8 US1, 8 US2, 7 US3. 23 parallelizable tasks (64%). TDD approach with test-first pattern enforced. Integration tests map to acceptance criteria."
  analyze: "Analysis complete: 22 validations passed (95% coverage), 2 medium warnings, 3 low priority items, 0 critical issues. Cross-artifact consistency validated. Ready for implementation."
