# Specification Quality Checklist: Zone breakout detection with volume confirmation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: specs/025-zone-breakout-detection/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable (60% breakout success rate, 85% flip accuracy, >20% integration rate, >21 days lifespan)
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined (4 scenarios + 4 edge cases)
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified (whipsaws, bidirectional flips, missing volume, intraday spikes)
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded (extends zone-detector, US1-US6 prioritized, MVP = US1-US3)
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified (parent feature 023 completed, volume data availability)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (FR-001 through FR-010 with specific thresholds)
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows (breakout detection, zone flipping, logging, history tracking)
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (HEART metrics defined with measurement queries)
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification (no mention of specific classes/methods beyond domain models)

## Notes

- **Completeness**: 16/16 checks passing (100%)
- **Clarifications**: 0 markers (all requirements clear)
- **Deployment**: No infrastructure changes (pure logic extension)
- **Ready for**: /plan â†’ architecture and component design
