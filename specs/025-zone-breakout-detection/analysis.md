## Constitution Alignment

### §Safety_First ✅
- **FR-009**: Graceful error handling on missing data (T081)
- **NFR-004**: Fail-safe mode implemented (log warning, continue)
- No auto-trading - system only detects and logs breakouts

### §Code_Quality ✅
- **T084**: mypy --strict type checking enforced
- **T085**: ruff linting enforced
- **T087**: 90% test coverage target (Constitution requirement)
- TDD approach: 15 test tasks written before implementation

### §Risk_Management ✅
- No trading decisions made by this feature (detection only)
- Circuit breakers not applicable (read-only feature)
- Input validation in T080 (BreakoutDetector.__init__)

### §Security ✅
- **T086**: bandit security scan (0 HIGH/CRITICAL target)
- No credentials needed (inherits from MarketDataService)
- Public market data only (no PII)

### §Data_Integrity ✅
- **FR-010**: Decimal precision enforced (T003, T015, T016)
- **NFR-003**: UTC timestamps enforced (T003)
- **FR-009**: Missing data validation (T081)

### §Testing_Requirements ✅
- **T087**: 90% coverage requirement
- **15 test tasks** in TDD format (write tests first)
- **T088**: Integration test for end-to-end workflow
- Performance benchmark (T082)

---

## Metrics

- **Requirements**: 10 functional + 6 non-functional = 16 total
- **Tasks**: 41 total (23 story-specific, 21 parallelizable)
- **User Stories**: 6 (US1-US3 MVP, US4-US6 optional)
- **Coverage**: 100% of requirements mapped to tasks
- **Test Tasks**: 15 (TDD approach)
- **Quality Gates**: 6 (mypy, ruff, bandit, pytest, integration, performance)
- **Ambiguity**: 0 vague terms, 0 unresolved placeholders
- **Duplication**: 0 potential duplicates detected
- **Critical Issues**: 0

---

## Architecture Validation

### ✅ Composition Over Inheritance (Research Decision 1)
- **Validated**: tasks.md shows BreakoutDetector as separate class (T014)
- **Evidence**: "Create BreakoutDetector class" (T014), not "Extend ZoneDetector"
- **Benefit**: No breaking changes to existing ZoneDetector

### ✅ Immutability Preserved (Research Decision 3)
- **Validated**: T020 tests "flip_zone() creates NEW Zone with flipped type"
- **Evidence**: "Returns new Zone" in T020 acceptance criteria
- **Pattern**: Functional programming approach maintained

### ✅ Decimal Precision (Constitution §Data_Integrity)
- **Validated**: 97 Decimal mentions across artifacts
- **Test Coverage**: T015, T016 test Decimal calculations
- **Anti-Pattern Check**: Test guardrails explicitly forbid float arithmetic

### ✅ Thread-Safe Logging (Extends Existing Pattern)
- **Validated**: T032 extends ZoneLogger (existing infrastructure)
- **Evidence**: "REUSE: Existing ZoneLogger thread-safety pattern (self._lock)"
- **No Duplication**: Reuses proven logging mechanism

### ✅ Dependency Injection (Constitution §Architecture)
- **Validated**: T014 "BreakoutDetector with __init__(config, market_data_service, logger)"
- **Testability**: T080 validates constructor parameters
- **Pattern**: Follows existing zone_detector.py pattern

## Task Sequencing Validation

### Phase Dependencies ✅
1. **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T001-T002 verify infrastructure
2. **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T003-T006 create models (BLOCKS all stories)
3. **Phase 3 (US1)**: T010-T017 breakout detection (independent)
4. **Phase 4 (US2)**: T020-T023 zone flipping (depends on US1)
5. **Phase 5 (US3)**: T030-T034 logging (depends on US1+US2)
6. **Phase 6-8 (Optional)**: T040-T060 enhancements
7. **Phase 9 (Polish)**: T080-T091 quality gates

### TDD Sequence ✅
- All story phases follow: Tests → Implementation pattern
- Example US1: T010-T013 (tests) → T014-T017 (implementation)
- Test-first approach enforced in 15/41 tasks (37%)

### Parallel Opportunities ✅
- 21 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
- Example: T003, T004, T005 (models) can run concurrently
- Reduces estimated time: 16-24 hours → ~12-18 hours with parallelization

## Risk Assessment

### Risk: Volume Data Availability (MEDIUM - Mitigated)
- **Impact**: Cannot confirm breakouts without volume (FR-002)
- **Likelihood**: Medium (API gaps possible)
- **Mitigation**: T081 - Graceful degradation (price-only detection)
- **Status**: ✅ Addressed in tasks

### Risk: False Breakouts / Whipsaws (LOW - Optional Feature)
- **Impact**: Trades based on flipped zones may fail
- **Likelihood**: High (40% expected per spec)
- **Mitigation**: US5 (T050-T051) - 5-bar validation
- **Status**: ⚠️ Optional (US5), recommend including in MVP

### Risk: Performance Degradation (LOW - Benchmarked)
- **Impact**: >200ms detection time (NFR-001 violation)
- **Likelihood**: Low (simple calculations)
- **Mitigation**: T082 - Performance benchmark with P95 <200ms
- **Status**: ✅ Proactively tested

### Risk: Integration Complexity (LOW - Clean API)
- **Impact**: Difficult to use BreakoutDetector
- **Likelihood**: Low (dependency injection, clean API)
- **Mitigation**: quickstart.md Scenario 6, T088 integration test
- **Status**: ✅ Comprehensive documentation

---

## Recommendations

### ✅ No Blocking Issues
All critical and high-priority issues resolved. Feature is ready for implementation.

### 💡 Optional Enhancements
1. **Consider including US5 (Whipsaw Validation) in MVP**
   - Rationale: 40% expected false breakout rate per spec
   - Benefit: Reduces trading on unreliable signals
   - Cost: +2 tasks (T050-T051), ~5-7 hours
   - Decision: Defer to implementation phase

2. **Add Test Fixtures Task to Phase 1**
   - Current: No fixture setup task in Phase 1
   - Recommendation: Add "T002a: Create test fixtures (conftest.py)"
   - Benefit: Standardize test data across 15 test tasks
   - Priority: Low (can create during T010 if needed)

### 📋 Task Execution Strategy
1. **Start with MVP (US1-US3)**: 23 tasks, 12-18 hours
2. **Validate with historical data**: Run quickstart Scenario 5 (breakout success rate)
3. **If success rate <60%**: Implement US5 (whipsaw validation)
4. **If success rate >60%**: Defer US4-US6 to backlog

---

## Next Actions

**✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

Next: `/implement`

/implement will:
1. Execute tasks from tasks.md (41 tasks total, 23 MVP)
2. Follow TDD where applicable (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR for 15 test tasks)
3. Apply composition pattern (BreakoutDetector composes with ZoneDetector)
4. Enforce Decimal precision (no float arithmetic)
5. Commit after each task or logical group
6. Update error-log.md to track implementation issues

**Estimated Duration**: 12-18 hours for MVP (US1-US3) with parallel execution

**Parallel Execution Groups**:
- Phase 2: T003, T004, T005 (models) → 3 concurrent
- Phase 3: T010, T011, T012, T013 (tests) → 4 concurrent
- Phase 4: T020, T021 (tests) → 2 concurrent
- Phase 5: T030, T031 (tests) → 2 concurrent
- Phase 9: T080, T081, T082, T083, T084, T085, T086 → 7 concurrent

**Quality Checkpoints**:
- After Phase 2: Verify models pass mypy --strict
- After Phase 3: Run T010-T013 tests (should fail - RED phase)
- After T017: All US1 tests should pass (GREEN phase)
- After Phase 9: Run T087 (coverage report), T088 (integration test)
