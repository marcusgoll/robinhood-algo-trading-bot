## Architecture Consistency

### Design Patterns Alignment

✅ **Two-Tier Architecture**: RiskManager orchestrates, OrderManager executes
- Spec: FR-001 describes separation of risk logic from order execution
- Plan: [ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS] specifies service layer pattern
- Tasks: T025 implements delegation to OrderManager

✅ **Dataclass Models**: Type-safe domain models
- Spec: Key Entities section defines PositionPlan, RiskManagementEnvelope
- Plan: [SCHEMA] specifies @dataclass pattern
- Tasks: T005-T007 create dataclasses

✅ **JSONL Audit Trail**: Structured logging for compliance
- Spec: FR-011 requires complete risk profile logging
- Plan: [RESEARCH DECISIONS] specifies logs/risk-management.jsonl
- Tasks: T015, T026 implement logging

✅ **Configuration Extension**: Mirror OrderManagementConfig pattern
- Spec: FR-010 requires risk_management config section
- Plan: [RESEARCH DECISIONS] - Configuration via risk_management section
- Tasks: T003, T004 extend Config

Estimated duration: 2-4 hours

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:
- Setup tasks (T001-T004): 4 parallel
- Model tasks (T005-T007): 3 parallel
- RED tests (T008-T020): 13 parallel
