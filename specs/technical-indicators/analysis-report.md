## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before /implement)

1. ✅ **Proceed to /implement** - All quality gates passed, no blockers identified
2. ✅ **Follow TDD approach** - Tasks ordered tests-first per Constitution §Code_Quality
3. ✅ **Use parallel execution** - 31/38 tasks (82%) can run in parallel
4. ✅ **Validate against TradingView** - T030-T032 manual validation critical for accuracy
5. ✅ **Enforce type safety** - T033 mypy strict mode before merge

### During Implementation

1. **Monitor test coverage** - Run T026-T029 after each phase, enforce ≥90%
2. **Benchmark early** - Run T035-T038 after implementation, optimize if needed
3. **Validate calculations** - Compare VWAP/EMA/MACD to TradingView during T030-T032
4. **Log all operations** - TradingLogger integration per Constitution §Audit_Everything
5. **Fail safely** - InsufficientDataError, DataValidationError per Constitution §Fail_Safe

### Post-Implementation

1. **Integration with bot.py** - Call validate_entry() before orders, check_exit_signals() during monitoring
2. **Performance monitoring** - Verify production performance meets NFR-004 targets
3. **Accuracy monitoring** - Periodically compare indicator values to TradingView
4. **Error tracking** - Monitor InsufficientDataError frequency, adjust thresholds if needed

## Next Phase

**Command**: `/implement`

**Execution Plan**:
1. Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003) - 3 tasks parallel

3. Phase 3: EMA Calculator (T009-T013) - TDD, 4 tests then impl
4. Phase 4: MACD Calculator (T014-T019) - TDD, 5 tests then impl
5. Phase 5: Service Facade (T020-T025) - TDD, 5 tests then impl
6. Phase 6: Validation (T026-T038) - Coverage, manual, performance tests

**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 hours (38 tasks, 82% parallelizable, TDD approach)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All 38 tasks completed
- ✅ Test coverage ≥90%
- ✅ VWAP, EMA, MACD calculations match TradingView within 0.5%
