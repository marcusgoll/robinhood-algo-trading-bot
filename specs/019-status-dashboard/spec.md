# Feature Specification: CLI Status Dashboard & Performance Metrics

**Branch**: `feature/019-status-dashboard`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Area**: infra
**From Roadmap**: Yes (v1.0.0 release)

## User Scenarios

### Primary User Story
As a trading bot operator, I need a real-time CLI dashboard displaying account status, current positions, and performance metrics so I can quickly assess session health, identify opportunities, and ensure I'm meeting performance targets without manually querying logs or APIs.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the bot is running and authenticated, **When** I run `python -m trading_bot.dashboard`, **Then** the CLI displays current buying power, account balance, open positions with P&L, and today's performance metrics refreshed every 5 seconds

2. **Given** I have open positions, **When** the dashboard refreshes, **Then** I see each position's symbol, quantity, entry price, current price, unrealized P&L ($), and P&L percentage (%) with color coding (green for profit, red for loss)

3. **Given** I've executed trades today, **When** I view performance metrics, **Then** I see:
   - Win rate (percentage of winning trades)
   - Average risk-reward ratio
   - Total P&L (realized + unrealized)
   - Current win/loss streak
   - Number of trades executed today
   - Total session count (trading days)

4. **Given** I've configured performance targets, **When** the dashboard displays metrics, **Then** I see actual values compared to targets with variance indicators (e.g., "Win Rate: 65% [Target: 60%] âœ“")

5. **Given** I want to export today's summary, **When** I press `E` key, **Then** the dashboard exports a JSON file and Markdown report with timestamp, all metrics, position snapshots, and target comparisons

6. **Given** the account data becomes stale (>60s), **When** the dashboard displays data, **Then** a staleness indicator appears to avoid acting on outdated information

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no positions are open?
  - Display "No open positions" with account cash balance and buying power only
- What happens when no trades executed today?
  - Show 0 trades today, display cumulative stats from trade history
- What happens if trade log file is missing or corrupted?
  - Gracefully handle error, display account data only, show warning message
- What happens during market hours vs after hours?
  - Display market status indicator (OPEN/CLOSED based on current time)
- What happens if targets file is missing?
  - Display metrics without target comparison, log warning about missing config
- What happens if account data API call fails?
  - Display cached data with stale indicator, retry on next refresh cycle

## User Stories (Prioritized)

## Visual References

N/A - No web UI components (CLI-only feature using `rich` library for terminal rendering)

## Success Metrics (HEART Framework)

See `./design/heart-metrics.md` for full HEART framework measurement plan.

**Summary**:
- **Happiness**: 5+ dashboard sessions/day (reduce manual checks)
- **Engagement**: 2-5 min/session (focused monitoring without distraction)
- **Adoption**: 90% of trading days using dashboard
- **Retention**: 80% weekly usage (sustained adoption)
- **Task Success**: <10 seconds time-to-insight (vs 3-5 minutes manual)

**Performance Targets**:
- Dashboard startup: <2 seconds (cold start)
- Refresh cycle: <500ms (account data + trade log read)
- Export generation: <1 second
- Memory footprint: <50MB (long-running CLI tool)

## Screens Inventory (UI Features Only)

N/A - CLI-only feature (no UI screens)

## Hypothesis

**Problem**: Bot operators manually check account status via multiple API calls and parse trade logs using grep/jq to assess session performance, taking 3-5 minutes per check and performed 5-10 times per trading day
- Evidence: No unified monitoring tool, manual queries documented in trade-logging spec
- Impact: Context switching disrupts focus (15-20 min daily analysis), delayed reaction to performance issues
- Gap: Cannot quickly answer "Am I meeting targets today?" or "What's my current risk exposure?"

**Solution**: Real-time CLI dashboard aggregating account data, position P&L, and performance metrics with target comparison in single view
- Change: Unified dashboard replaces manual API calls and log queries
- Mechanism: Polls account-data-module (60s cache) and reads trade logs, displays in formatted sections with color coding

**Prediction**: Unified dashboard will reduce session health assessment time from 3-5 minutes to <10 seconds
- Primary metric: Time-to-insight <10s (currently 3-5 minutes)
- Expected improvement: -96% reduction in assessment time
- Confidence: High (eliminates manual context assembly, proven CLI dashboard pattern)

## Context Strategy & Signal Design

- **System prompt altitude**: Feature-level - "Build CLI dashboard displaying account + performance metrics"
- **Tool surface**: `rich` library for CLI rendering, account-data-module API, trade log file reader
- **Examples in scope**: 3 canonical examples (positions table, metrics panel, export output)
- **Context budget**: <15k tokens (moderate complexity: data aggregation + formatting + live refresh)
- **Retrieval strategy**: JIT - Load account data and trade logs on each refresh cycle, no persistent state
- **Memory artifacts**: NOTES.md updated after implementation, no TODO tracking (single-phase feature)
- **Compaction cadence**: Not needed (moderate feature scope)
- **Sub-agents**: Not used (cohesive single-purpose tool)

**Platform Dependencies**: None (pure Python CLI application)

**Environment Variables**: None required (uses existing account-data-module config)

**Breaking Changes**: No (new feature, not modifying existing APIs)

**Migration Required**: No (no database schema changes)

## Assumptions

1. **Account Data Access**: Assumes account-data-module is already configured and authenticated
2. **Trade Log Format**: Assumes trade logs follow structured JSONL format from trade-logging module
3. **Terminal Support**: Assumes terminal supports ANSI color codes and Unicode characters (rich library requirement)
4. **Refresh Interval**: 5-second refresh is reasonable default (not configurable in MVP)
5. **Target File Format**: YAML format for dashboard-targets.yaml (industry standard)
6. **Export Location**: logs/ directory exists and is writable
7. **Time Zone**: Market hours based on US Eastern Time (NYSE/NASDAQ standard)

## Dependencies

**Required Modules** (from roadmap):
- **account-data-module**: Provides buying power, balance, positions, day trade count
- **performance-tracking**: Provides TradeQueryHelper, MetricsCalculator for statistics
- **trade-logging**: Provides structured trade logs (trades-structured.jsonl)

**External Libraries**:
- `rich`: Terminal rendering and formatting (industry-standard CLI UI library)

## Success Criteria

Users can assess session health in under 10 seconds by launching the dashboard and viewing all key metrics (account status, positions, performance) in a single unified display, eliminating the need for manual API calls and log parsing.

**Verification**:
1. Launch dashboard â†’ All sections render with current data within 2 seconds
2. Open positions exist â†’ P&L calculations match manual verification
3. Trades executed â†’ Metrics match TradeQueryHelper calculations
4. Export summary â†’ Files generated in logs/ with complete data
5. API failure â†’ Dashboard shows cached data with stale indicator (no crash)
