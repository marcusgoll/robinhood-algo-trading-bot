# Specification Quality Checklist: status-dashboard

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: specs/019-status-dashboard/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (0 found)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS (4/4)
- Specification focuses on user outcomes, not technical implementation
- Written in business language (account status, positions, performance metrics)
- No mention of Python, rich library, or specific classes/functions

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS (8/8)
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- All 16 functional requirements are testable
- Success criteria include quantified targets (<10s time-to-insight, 90% adoption)
- 6 edge cases identified with handling strategies
- Dependencies clearly stated (account-data-module, performance-tracking, trade-logging)

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS (4/4)
- 16 functional requirements with clear pass/fail criteria
- 6 acceptance scenarios cover primary user flows
- HEART metrics define measurable success (see design/heart-metrics.md)
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults

## Notes

**Overall Assessment**: ✅ SPECIFICATION READY

The specification is complete, testable, and technology-agnostic. All quality gates passed.

**Strengths**:
1. Clear user scenarios with Given/When/Then format
2. Comprehensive edge case handling
3. HEART metrics framework with measurement sources
4. User stories prioritized (P1/P2/P3) for incremental delivery
5. Constitution principles referenced for quality gates

**Recommendations**:
- Proceed to /plan phase
- No clarifications needed (all requirements unambiguous)
- Existing implementation at src/trading_bot/dashboard/ can be referenced during implementation

**Next Phase**: `/plan` (no ambiguities to resolve)
