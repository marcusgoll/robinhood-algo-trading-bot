# Feature: health-check

## Overview
Session health monitoring to maintain active Robinhood API connection and detect authentication issues proactively.

## Research Findings

### Finding 1: Authentication Module Analysis
**Source**: src/trading_bot/auth/robinhood_auth.py
- Current implementation has login/logout/refresh methods
- robin_stocks library handles session automatically via pickle file (.robinhood.pickle)
- Token refresh is placeholder (robin_stocks does automatic refresh)
- No active session monitoring or health checks exist
- Decision: Health check needed to verify session is valid before assuming it is

### Finding 2: Roadmap Context
**Source**: .spec-flow/memory/roadmap.md
- Feature already in backlog with preliminary requirements
- Classified as "Intra: Yes" (small scope)
- Impact: 4, Effort: 2, Confidence: 0.9, Score: 1.80
- Unblocked: authentication-module already shipped
- Requirements align with ping API, verify auth status, log session duration, auto-reauth

### Finding 3: Constitution Compliance
**Source**: .spec-flow/memory/constitution.md
- §Safety_First: "Fail safe, not fail open" - Must halt if auth fails, not continue blindly
- §Audit_Everything: "Every trade decision must be logged with reasoning" - Session status changes must be logged
- §Risk_Management: "Validate all inputs - API responses" - Must validate health check responses
- §Code_Quality: Type hints required, test coverage ≥90%
- §Testing_Requirements: Unit tests required for every function

### Finding 4: Error Handling Framework
**Source**: specs/error-handling-framework/ (recently shipped)
- @with_retry decorator available with exponential backoff
- RetryPolicy system with predefined policies (DEFAULT, AGGRESSIVE, CONSERVATIVE)
- Circuit breaker with sliding window for repeated failures
- Decision: Reuse error handling framework for health check retries

### Finding 5: Trading Bot Integration Points
**Source**: src/trading_bot/bot.py (inferred from patterns)
- Bot likely has start/stop methods that call auth.login()
- No periodic health checks during bot operation
- Session assumed valid after initial login
- Decision: Health check should run periodically (every 5 minutes) and before critical operations

## Feature Classification
- UI screens: false (CLI/background service only)
- Improvement: false (new capability, not improving existing)
- Measurable: true (session uptime, reauth frequency trackable)
- Deployment impact: false (local-only feature, no env changes)

## System Components Analysis
Not applicable - no UI components needed (CLI/background only)

## Key Decisions
1. **Health Check Frequency**: Every 5 minutes during active trading hours (7am-10am EST)
2. **Lightweight Probe**: Use robin_stocks account profile check (minimal API overhead)
3. **Auto-Reauth Strategy**: Single retry with exponential backoff, then fail-safe halt
4. **Session Metrics**: Track session duration, reauth count, last health check time
5. **Integration Point**: Called by TradingBot before executing trades and on timer
6. **Fail-Safe Behavior**: Health check failure trips circuit breaker (§Safety_First)

## Checkpoints
- Phase 0 (Spec-flow): 2025-10-09
- Phase 1 (Plan): 2025-10-09
- Phase 2 (Tasks): 2025-10-09

## Phase Summaries

### Phase 2: Task Breakdown (2025-10-09)
**Summary**: Created 40 concrete implementation tasks following TDD methodology
- Total tasks: 40 (4 setup, 16 RED tests, 15 GREEN implementation, 3 refactor, 5 integration, 4 validation)
- TDD breakdown: 15 RED → 11 GREEN → 3 REFACTOR cycles
- Parallel execution: 11 tasks can run concurrently (setup and validation)
- Reuse: 7 existing components (RobinhoodAuth, @with_retry, CircuitBreaker, TradingLogger, mask_username, StructuredTradeLogger, TradingBot)
- New components: 3 (SessionHealthMonitor, HealthCheckLogger, health module)

**Key Task Decisions**:
1. TDD structure enforced: Every behavior has RED test before GREEN implementation
2. All tasks use concrete file paths (no generic placeholders)
3. Task dependencies explicit: GREEN→TNN notation shows test-implementation pairing
4. Integration tasks separate phase after core implementation complete
5. Validation tasks run last: coverage check, type check, documentation, rollback plan

**Artifacts**: specs/health-check/tasks.md

**Next Phase**: /analyze (cross-artifact consistency check, risk identification, implementation hints)
