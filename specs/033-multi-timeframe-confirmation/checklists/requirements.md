# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Timeframe Confirmation for Momentum Trades

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: specs/033-multi-timeframe-confirmation/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Uses existing patterns, no framework details in requirements
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs - Clear win rate improvement hypothesis (52% → 63%)
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders - User scenarios explain trader benefits without technical jargon
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed - User stories, acceptance scenarios, requirements, success metrics all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (0 markers)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous - All FR-001 through FR-012 have clear validation criteria
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable - HEART metrics with specific targets (win rate 63%, early exit <18%)
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic - "Win rate improvement", "validation latency", no implementation tech mentioned
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined - 4 primary scenarios + 3 edge cases documented
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified - API failures, data insufficiency, conflicting timeframe signals
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded - MVP focuses on daily + 4H validation, excludes weekly/monthly timeframes
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified - 5 assumptions documented, depends on existing market data service

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - Each FR has measurable condition
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows - US1-US5 cover validation, logging, degradation, backtesting
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - Hypothesis aligns with HEART metrics targets
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification - Requirements describe "what" (validate trend, log events) not "how" (class names, methods)

## Notes

**Status**: ✅ All 16 checklist items passed

**Quality Summary**:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (clear requirements)
- Technology-agnostic success criteria (win rate, latency, not "Redis cache" or "React component")
- Comprehensive edge case handling (API failures, data gaps, conflicting signals)
- Clear MVP scope (daily + 4H validation, excludes lower-priority timeframes)

**Ready for**: `/plan` phase - architecture design and implementation planning

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-28
