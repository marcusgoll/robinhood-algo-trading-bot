# Feature: market-data-module

## Overview

Market data and trading hours module for Robinhood stock trading bot. Provides real-time stock quotes, historical price data for backtesting, market hours checking, and enforces 7am-10am EST trading window (peak volatility). Ensures data integrity through validation of all market data (timestamps, bounds, completeness) and implements rate limit protection per Constitution requirements.

## Research Findings

- Finding 1: Feature exists in roadmap with clear requirements
  Source: .spec-flow/memory/roadmap.md
  Context: Area=api, Role=all, Impact=5, Effort=2, Score=2.25
  Requirements: Real-time quotes, historical data, market hours, 7am-10am EST trading window

- Finding 2: Similar pattern in authentication-module spec
  Source: specs/authentication-module/spec.md
  Pattern: API wrapper module with session management, error handling, validation
  Decision: Follow same structure - config, validation, error handling, audit logging

- Finding 3: Constitution compliance required
  Source: .spec-flow/memory/constitution.md
  Key principles: Safety First, Code Quality, Risk Management, Data Integrity
  Relevant sections: Validate market data (timestamps, bounds), Handle missing data, Time zone awareness (UTC), Rate limit protection

- Finding 4: Status checks show unblocked
  Source: Roadmap analysis
  Status: [UNBLOCKED: authentication-module shipped], [MERGED: trading-hours-restriction]
  Decision: Can proceed with implementation

## System Components Analysis

**Feature Classification**:
- UI screens: false (Backend API module only)
- Improvement: false (New feature, not improving existing)
- Measurable: false (Infrastructure module, no direct user interaction)
- Deployment impact: false (Pure Python module, no platform changes)

**Reusable Components** (from architecture):
- Authentication: RobinhoodAuth class (from authentication-module)
- Logger: Audit logging infrastructure
- Config: Environment variable loading

**New Components Needed**:
- MarketDataService: Main service class for data retrieval
- TradingHoursValidator: Trading window enforcement (7am-10am EST)
- DataValidator: Market data validation (timestamps, bounds, completeness)

**Rationale**: Backend-only module, no UI components needed. Focus on data integrity, error handling, and trading hours enforcement per Constitution.

## Key Decisions

1. **Trading Hours Enforcement**: Implemented strict 7am-10am EST window per roadmap requirement to focus on peak volatility hours. Trades blocked outside this window with TradingHoursError.

2. **Data Validation Strategy**: All market data validated before use - no unvalidated data returned to prevent bad trading decisions. Follows Constitution Data_Integrity principle.

3. **Rate Limit Protection**: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s) with 3 retry attempts. Respects Robinhood API limits per Constitution Risk_Management.

4. **Timezone Standardization**: All timestamps stored/processed in UTC, converted to EST only for trading hours validation. Prevents timezone bugs.

5. **Fail-Safe Error Handling**: All validation failures raise errors (don't fill gaps or guess). Bot stops rather than trading with bad data per Constitution Safety_First.

## Checkpoints
- Phase 0 (Spec-flow): 2025-10-08
- Phase 1 (Plan): 2025-10-08
  - Artifacts: plan.md, contracts/api.yaml, error-log.md
  - Research decisions: 6
  - Reuse opportunities: 6 components (error-handling-framework, logger, time_utils, auth)
  - New components: 5 (MarketDataService, data_models, validators, exceptions, tests)
  - Migration required: No

## Phase 1 Summary (Planning)

**Architecture**:
- Pattern: Service pattern with dependency injection (RobinhoodAuth)
- Error handling: Reuse @with_retry decorator from error-handling-framework
- Validation: Fail-fast validation (raise NonRetriableError on bad data)

**Reuse Analysis**:
- 6 components identified for reuse (error_handling, logger, time_utils, auth, config)
- 0 new dependencies (all satisfied by existing requirements.txt)
- 5 new components to create (service, models, validators, exceptions, tests)

**Key Architectural Decisions**:
1. Reuse error-handling-framework for retry logic (prevents duplication)
2. Extend time_utils.py instead of creating duplicate trading hours logic
3. Use existing RobinhoodAuth for session management
4. Create custom exceptions (DataValidationError, TradingHoursError) as NonRetriableError subclasses
5. Stateless service (no database, all data fetched on-demand)

**Performance Targets**:
- Quote fetch: <2s (95th percentile)
- Historical data: <10s (95th percentile)
- Trading hours validation: <100ms (99th percentile)
