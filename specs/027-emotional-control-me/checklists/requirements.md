# Specification Quality Checklist: Emotional control mechanisms

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: specs/027-emotional-control-me/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (0 found)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined (5 scenarios with Given/When/Then)
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified (corrupted state, concurrent access)
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded (Out of Scope section)
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (23 AC items)
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows (activation, recovery, manual reset, persistence)
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items complete. Specification is ready for planning phase. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - requirements are unambiguous with informed defaults based on industry best practices.

Key strengths:
- Clear business value and problem statement
- Comprehensive functional requirements (14 FRs)
- 23 detailed acceptance criteria with pass/fail conditions
- 5 user scenarios covering all major flows
- Technology-agnostic success criteria focused on user outcomes
- Well-defined constraints, assumptions, and out-of-scope items
- Constitution compliance explicitly referenced
