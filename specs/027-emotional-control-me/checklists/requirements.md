**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: specs/027-emotional-control-me/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (0 found)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined (5 scenarios with Given/When/Then)
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified (corrupted state, concurrent access)
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded (Out of Scope section)
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness
