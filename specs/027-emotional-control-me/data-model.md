# Data Model: emotional-control-me

## Entities

### EmotionalControlState
**Purpose**: Persistent state tracking emotional control activation status and recovery progress

**Fields**:
- `is_active`: bool - Whether emotional control is currently active (True = 25% sizing, False = 100% sizing)
- `activated_at`: str (ISO 8601) - Timestamp when emotional control was last activated
- `trigger_reason`: str - Reason for activation (SINGLE_LOSS | STREAK_LOSS)
- `account_balance_at_activation`: Decimal - Account balance when triggered (for audit)
- `loss_amount`: Decimal (optional) - Loss amount that triggered activation (if SINGLE_LOSS)
- `consecutive_losses`: int - Count of consecutive losing trades (reset on win or deactivation)
- `consecutive_wins`: int - Count of consecutive winning trades during active period (reset on loss)
- `last_updated`: str (ISO 8601) - Timestamp of last state modification

**Validation Rules**:
- `is_active`: Required, boolean (from FR-001, FR-002)
- `trigger_reason`: Must be one of [SINGLE_LOSS, STREAK_LOSS, null] (from FR-004)
- `loss_amount`: Must be ≥ 0 if present (from FR-001)
- `consecutive_losses`: Must be ≥ 0, triggers activation at 3 (from FR-001)
- `consecutive_wins`: Must be ≥ 0, triggers deactivation at 3 (from FR-003)
- `account_balance_at_activation`: Must be > 0 (from FR-001)

**State Transitions**:
- INACTIVE → ACTIVE (on single loss ≥3% OR consecutive loss streak ≥3)
- ACTIVE → INACTIVE (on 3 consecutive wins OR manual reset)

No database required - file-based storage only.

**File Structure**:
```
logs/
  emotional_control/
    state.json                    # Current state (single record, atomic writes)
    events-2025-10-22.jsonl       # Daily event audit trail (append-only)
    events-2025-10-23.jsonl
    ...

    ↓
EmotionalControl.update_state()
    ├─→ AccountData.get_portfolio_value() [account balance]
    ├─→ Check single loss threshold (≥3%)
    ├─→ Check consecutive loss streak (≥3)
    ├─→ Check consecutive win streak (≥3)
    ├─→ Determine state transition (ACTIVATE or DEACTIVATE)
    ├─→ Create EmotionalControlEvent
    ├─→ Write event to logs/emotional_control/events-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
    └─→ Persist EmotionalControlState to logs/emotional_control/state.json (atomic write)

Next Trade Planning
    ↓
RiskManager.calculate_position_plan()
    ├─→ EmotionalControl.get_position_multiplier() [returns 0.25 or 1.00]
    └─→ Apply multiplier: position_size = base_size × multiplier

## Concurrency Considerations

**Thread Safety**: File-based storage requires atomic operations
- **State writes**: Use temp file + rename for atomic updates (prevents partial writes on crash)
- **Event log writes**: Append-only, no lock required (OS guarantees atomic appends <4KB)
- **State reads**: Single-threaded bot, no read locking needed

**Race Conditions**: None expected in single-threaded bot architecture
- If multi-threading added in future: Add file locks for state.json writes

---

## Performance Characteristics

**Memory**:
- EmotionalControlState: ~200 bytes (in-memory)
- EmotionalControlConfig: ~150 bytes (in-memory)
- Event log: ~300 bytes per event (disk only)

**Disk**:
- state.json: <1 KB (single record)
- events-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl: ~300 bytes per event × daily trades (~30-50 events/day = 15 KB/day)
- Daily rotation keeps disk usage manageable (30 days × 15 KB = 450 KB)

**I/O**:
- State read (bot startup): 1 file read (<1ms)
- State write (per update): 1 temp file write + 1 rename (<10ms)
- Event log write (per event): 1 append (<5ms)

---

## Data Retention

**State File**: Overwritten on each update (single current state only)
**Event Logs**: Daily rotation, retain 30 days (configurable)
**Compliance**: Event logs provide complete audit trail per Constitution §Audit_Everything
