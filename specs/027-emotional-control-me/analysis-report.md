## Recommendations

### Implementation Order
1. **Phase 1-2 (Setup + Models)**: Execute sequentially, foundation for all other work
2. **Phase 3 (Core Logic)**: Critical path, requires careful TDD implementation
3. **Phase 4-5 (Integration + CLI)**: Can proceed once Phase 3 core methods complete
4. **Phase 6 (Testing)**: Parallelize test tasks for speed
5. **Phase 7 (Deployment)**: Final validation before staging

### Best Practices
1. **Follow TDD strictly**: Write tests first for all Phase 3 tasks (T007-T015)
2. **Reuse patterns**: DailyProfitTracker is excellent reference, copy patterns exactly
3. **Parallel execution**: Leverage 14 parallelizable tasks for speed
4. **Incremental commits**: Commit after each completed task for clean history
5. **Performance monitoring**: Run T030 benchmark early to catch regressions

### Risk Mitigation
1. **State persistence**: Test T009 (atomic writes) thoroughly - critical for data integrity
2. **Fail-safe logic**: Validate T008 (corrupted state → ACTIVE) works as expected
3. **Integration**: Test T029 (RiskManager integration) with real AccountData for accuracy

**Analysis Complete**: 2025-10-22
**Confidence Level**: HIGH
**Recommendation**: PROCEED TO IMPLEMENTATION

**Validation Methodology**: Cross-artifact consistency analysis using Constitution-driven quality gates. All requirements traced to tasks, all acceptance criteria mapped to tests, all patterns validated against existing codebase.

**Analyst Notes**: This is an exemplary feature specification with excellent attention to detail, clear requirements, comprehensive testing strategy, and strong alignment with Constitution principles. The use of the DailyProfitTracker v1.5.0 pattern as a reference is particularly strong - it provides a proven template for state management and event logging. No remediation needed before implementation.
