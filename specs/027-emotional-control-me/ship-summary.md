### Files Changed

30 files changed, 5,878 insertions(+)
- Core implementation: 4 files (tracker.py, models.py, config.py, cli.py)

- Specifications: 9 artifact files (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, etc.)
- Integration: RiskManager position sizing multiplier

## Feature Summary

Implements emotional control safeguards to protect traders from making poor decisions during losing streaks. The system automatically reduces position sizes to 25% after significant losses and enforces recovery periods to prevent emotional revenge trading.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Automatic activation on single loss ≥3% OR 3 consecutive losses
- Position sizing reduced to 25% of normal during active state
- Recovery requires 3 consecutive wins OR manual admin reset
- Fail-safe design: State corruption defaults to conservative sizing
- JSONL event logging for full audit trail

**Production Readiness**:
- ✅ 68 tests passing (unit + integration + performance)
- ✅ 89.39% coverage on core tracker logic
- ✅ 100% coverage on models and config
- ✅ Performance: <10ms P95 for update_state()
- ✅ Security: 0 vulnerabilities, defensive programming
- ✅ Fail-safe behavior verified

## Next Steps

1. Monitor position sizing behavior in production trading
2. Track activation events (SINGLE_LOSS vs STREAK_LOSS distribution)
3. Measure capital preserved during losing streaks
4. Validate recovery timing (consecutive wins vs manual resets)

## Rollback Instructions

For local builds, rollback by reverting git commits:

```bash
# Revert the merge commit
git revert 4839c64

# Or reset to previous state
git reset --hard d06e66f
git push origin main --force
```
