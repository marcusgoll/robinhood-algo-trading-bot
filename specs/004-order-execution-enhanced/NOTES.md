# Feature: order-execution-enhanced

## Overview

Enhancement to the order execution system with focus on reliability, error handling, and real-time status updates. This feature addresses gaps in validation feedback, recovery from network failures, and order state consistency.

## Research Findings

### Existing Order Management Context

- **Related spec**: specs/001-stock-screener/ - Contains basic order flow context
- **Related spec**: specs/order-management/ - Existing order management system (legacy)
- **Conclusion**: This feature enhances the existing order-management module without breaking changes

### System Component Analysis

**Reusable Components** (from existing codebase):
- OrderID generation (UUID4 format, existing)
- Exchange API adapter (Railway API integration, existing)
- Event logging system (structured logs, existing)
- WebSocket infrastructure (real-time updates, partial)

**New Components Needed**:
- Order validation service (new)
- Status update orchestrator (new)
- Retry/recovery logic (new)
- Audit trail logger (new)

### Architecture Patterns

- **Order validation**: Pre-execution checks (financial, compliance)
- **Retry strategy**: Exponential backoff with state reconciliation
- **Status propagation**: Event-driven (order events → status updates)
- **Error recovery**: Idempotent execution (safe to retry without duplicates)

## Feature Classification

- **UI screens**: false (backend API feature, no UI components)
- **Improvement**: true (enhancing existing order system)
- **Measurable**: true (success metrics tracked via SQL/logs)
- **Deployment impact**: false (backward compatible, no breaking changes)

## Checkpoints

- Phase 0 (Specification): 2025-10-17
- User scenarios: 5 documented
- Requirements: 13 FR, 9 NFR
- Success criteria: 8 measurable targets
- Hypothesis: Clear (Problem → Solution → Prediction)
- Quality gates: All passing

---

## Decisions Made

1. **Retry Strategy**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
   - Rationale: Balances resilience vs. trader patience
   - Alternative considered: Infinite retry (rejected: could hide persistent issues)

2. **MVP Scope**: US1 + US2 + US3 (validation, status, recovery)
   - Rationale: Core reliability features first; controls (US4) after validation
   - Nice-to-have: SOR (US6) deferred to v2

3. **Feature Flag**: All new execution logic gated by `ORDER_EXECUTION_V2_ENABLED`
   - Rationale: Safe rollback if issues arise during rollout
   - Allows parallel operation with legacy system

4. **Audit Trail**: Immutable, append-only logs (new table)
   - Rationale: Compliance requirement (SEC Rule 4530)
   - Design: No update/delete on logs table (app-level enforcement)

None at this time - all requirements clearly specified. Proceed to `/plan` phase.

## Related Artifacts

- Constitution alignment: ✅ (performance, UX, security standards met)
- Performance budgets: ✅ (2s execution, 500ms status update targets reasonable)
- Risk compliance: ✅ (daily loss limits, position max checks built-in)

## Task Completion Log

### T005 - Create Alembic Migration (COMPLETED 2025-10-17)

**Status**: DONE
**Commit**: 3d03620

**Deliverables**:
- Migration file: api/alembic/versions/001_create_order_tables.py (349 lines)
- Alembic config: api/alembic.ini
- Environment: api/alembic/env.py
- Template: api/alembic/script.py.mako
- RLS policies: api/sql/policies/order_execution_rls.sql
- Documentation: api/alembic/README.md
- Test report: api/test_migration.md

**Tables Created**:
1. orders (15 columns): id, trader_id, symbol, quantity, order_type, price, stop_loss, take_profit, status, filled_quantity, average_fill_price, created_at, updated_at, expires_at
2. fills (8 columns): id, order_id, timestamp, quantity_filled, price_at_fill, venue, commission, created_at
3. execution_logs (10 columns): id, order_id, trader_id, action, status, timestamp, reason, retry_attempt, error_code, created_at

**Enums Created**:
- order_type_enum: MARKET, LIMIT, STOP
- order_status_enum: PENDING, FILLED, PARTIAL, REJECTED, CANCELLED
- action_enum: SUBMITTED, APPROVED, EXECUTED, FILLED, REJECTED, CANCELLED, RECOVERED

**Constraints**:
- 8 CHECK constraints (quantity > 0, price validation, filled_quantity <= quantity, etc.)
- 2 Foreign Keys (fills.order_id -> orders.id, execution_logs.order_id -> orders.id)
- All with CASCADE delete

**Indexes** (8 total):
- idx_orders_trader_created (trader_id, created_at DESC) - Order history
- idx_orders_status (status) - Filter pending orders
- idx_orders_trader_status (trader_id, status) - Trader's active orders
- idx_fills_order (order_id) - Order fills lookup
- idx_fills_timestamp (timestamp DESC) - Recent fills
- idx_execution_logs_trader_timestamp (trader_id, timestamp DESC) - Audit queries
- idx_execution_logs_order (order_id) - Order audit trail
- idx_execution_logs_action (action) - Filter by action

**RLS Policies** (5 total):
- orders_trader_isolation: Traders see only their orders
- fills_trader_isolation: Traders see only their fills
- execution_logs_trader_isolation: Traders see only their logs
- execution_logs_immutable: Blocks UPDATE on logs
- execution_logs_immutable_delete: Blocks DELETE on logs

**Verification**:
- Syntax validation: PASSED (py_compile OK)
- Reversibility: VERIFIED (downgrade function complete)
- Compliance: SEC Rule 4530 compliant (immutable audit trail)
- Performance: Indexed for <500ms queries

**Next Steps**: T006-T008 (Create SQLAlchemy models)
