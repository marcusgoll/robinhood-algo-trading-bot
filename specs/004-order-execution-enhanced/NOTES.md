# Feature: order-execution-enhanced

## Overview

Enhancement to the order execution system with focus on reliability, error handling, and real-time status updates. This feature addresses gaps in validation feedback, recovery from network failures, and order state consistency.

## Research Findings

### Existing Order Management Context

- **Related spec**: specs/001-stock-screener/ - Contains basic order flow context
- **Related spec**: specs/order-management/ - Existing order management system (legacy)
- **Conclusion**: This feature enhances the existing order-management module without breaking changes

### System Component Analysis

**Reusable Components** (from existing codebase):
- OrderID generation (UUID4 format, existing)
- Exchange API adapter (Railway API integration, existing)
- Event logging system (structured logs, existing)
- WebSocket infrastructure (real-time updates, partial)

**New Components Needed**:
- Order validation service (new)
- Status update orchestrator (new)
- Retry/recovery logic (new)
- Audit trail logger (new)

### Architecture Patterns

- **Order validation**: Pre-execution checks (financial, compliance)
- **Retry strategy**: Exponential backoff with state reconciliation
- **Status propagation**: Event-driven (order events → status updates)
- **Error recovery**: Idempotent execution (safe to retry without duplicates)

## Feature Classification

- **UI screens**: false (backend API feature, no UI components)
- **Improvement**: true (enhancing existing order system)
- **Measurable**: true (success metrics tracked via SQL/logs)
- **Deployment impact**: false (backward compatible, no breaking changes)

## Checkpoints

- Phase 0 (Specification): 2025-10-17
- User scenarios: 5 documented
- Requirements: 13 FR, 9 NFR
- Success criteria: 8 measurable targets
- Hypothesis: Clear (Problem → Solution → Prediction)
- Quality gates: All passing

## Decisions Made

1. **Retry Strategy**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
   - Rationale: Balances resilience vs. trader patience
   - Alternative considered: Infinite retry (rejected: could hide persistent issues)

2. **MVP Scope**: US1 + US2 + US3 (validation, status, recovery)
   - Rationale: Core reliability features first; controls (US4) after validation
   - Nice-to-have: SOR (US6) deferred to v2

3. **Feature Flag**: All new execution logic gated by `ORDER_EXECUTION_V2_ENABLED`
   - Rationale: Safe rollback if issues arise during rollout
   - Allows parallel operation with legacy system

4. **Audit Trail**: Immutable, append-only logs (new table)
   - Rationale: Compliance requirement (SEC Rule 4530)
   - Design: No update/delete on logs table (app-level enforcement)

## Related Artifacts

- Constitution alignment: ✅ (performance, UX, security standards met)
- Performance budgets: ✅ (2s execution, 500ms status update targets reasonable)
- Risk compliance: ✅ (daily loss limits, position max checks built-in)
