# Specification Quality Checklist: order-execution-enhanced

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: specs/004-order-execution-enhanced/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers found (0 total)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable (8 defined with % targets)
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no tech stack mentioned)
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined (5 scenarios in primary story)
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified (5 edge cases listed)
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded (MVP: US1+US2+US3; Phase 2: US4+US5; Defer: US6)
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified (user stories show P1/P2/P3 deps)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (13 FR with specific tests)
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows (5 scenarios: submit, validate, fill, cancel, error recovery)
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes (8 success criteria with targets)
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification (all technology-agnostic)

## Notes

âœ… **All checks passed** - Specification is complete, clear, and ready for planning phase.

### Quality Assessment

**Strengths**:
- Clear user scenarios with business context
- Comprehensive requirement coverage (13 FR + 9 NFR)
- Measurable success criteria with specific targets
- Well-prioritized user stories (P1: MVP reliability, P2: controls, P3: future)
- Hypothesis clearly states problem/solution/prediction
- Zero ambiguities or clarifications needed

**Ready for**: `/plan` phase
