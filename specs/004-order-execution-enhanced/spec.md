# Feature Specification: Order Execution Enhanced

**Branch**: `004-order-execution-enhanced`
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Draft
**Feature #**: 004

## User Scenarios

### Primary User Story

Traders need to execute orders with improved reliability, better error handling, and real-time status updates. Currently, the order execution system lacks robust validation, clear feedback mechanisms, and doesn't handle edge cases like network failures or partial fills gracefully.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a trader initiates an order with valid parameters, **When** the system processes it, **Then** the order executes successfully and the trader receives immediate confirmation with order ID and status.

2. **Given** a trader submits an order with invalid parameters, **When** validation fails, **Then** the system returns a clear, actionable error message explaining what's wrong and how to fix it.

3. **Given** an order is partially filled, **When** execution continues, **Then** the system updates the trader's position in real-time and logs each fill event with timestamp and quantity.

4. **Given** a network failure occurs during order transmission, **When** the connection is restored, **Then** the system reconciles order status without duplicating orders.

5. **Given** an order reaches maximum slippage, **When** the trader configured a limit, **Then** the system automatically cancels the order and notifies the trader with the reason.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the exchange connection drops mid-execution?
- How does the system handle orders that partially fill and then get rejected?
- What if a trader tries to execute an order for a suspended or delisted stock?
- How does the system behave under high market volatility (price gaps)?
- What if order execution conflicts with risk management rules (position limits)?

## User Stories (Prioritized)

### Priority 1 (MVP) ðŸŽ¯

**US1** [P1]: **Robust Order Validation**
- As a trader, I want orders to be validated before execution so that invalid orders don't create false attempts.
- **Acceptance**:
  - All parameter validation (quantity > 0, valid price ranges, account balance check) completes in <100ms
  - Validation errors are specific and actionable (e.g., "Insufficient funds for $5,000 order; available: $3,200")
  - System rejects orders violating risk management rules (max position size, daily loss limit)
- **Independent test**: Single-user validation flow without market data
- **Effort**: M (4-8 hours)

**US2** [P1]: **Real-Time Order Status Updates**
- As a trader, I want to see live order status (pending, filled, partial, rejected) so that I know execution progress.
- **Acceptance**:
  - Status updates propagate to UI within 500ms of execution change
  - Traders can subscribe to order status stream (WebSocket or polling)
  - Each status change includes timestamp, filled quantity, average price
- **Independent test**: Simulator-based order execution with status tracking
- **Effort**: L (8-16 hours)

**US3** [P1]: **Graceful Error Handling & Recovery**
- As a trader, I want the system to recover from network failures without losing orders or duplicating executions.
- **Acceptance**:
  - Failed orders are automatically retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff
  - System checks exchange for order status before re-attempting (prevents duplicate orders)
  - Traders can manually acknowledge failed orders or retry
- **Independent test**: Network failure simulation with mock exchange
- **Effort**: L (8-16 hours)

### Priority 2 (Enhancement)

**US4** [P2]: **Slippage & Execution Limit Controls**
- As a trader, I want to set execution limits (max slippage, max wait time) so that I can control execution quality.
- **Acceptance**:
  - Orders automatically cancel if slippage exceeds trader-set limit
  - Timeout cancellation works (e.g., "cancel if not filled in 30 seconds")
  - System logs reason for cancellation (timeout, slippage, user request)
- **Depends on**: US1, US2
- **Effort**: M (4-8 hours)

**US5** [P2]: **Execution Audit Trail & Reporting**
- As a compliance officer, I want complete audit logs of all order executions so that I can verify trades for regulatory purposes.
- **Acceptance**:
  - All executions logged with timestamp, trader ID, order ID, price, quantity, status
  - Audit trail is immutable (append-only, no edits)
  - Traders can download execution reports (CSV, PDF) for date ranges
- **Depends on**: US2
- **Effort**: M (4-8 hours)

### Priority 3 (Nice-to-have)

**US6** [P3]: **Smart Order Routing (SOR)**
- As a trader, I want orders routed to the best available price across multiple venues so that I get better fills.
- **Acceptance**:
  - System compares bid/ask across configured venues
  - Automatically routes to venue with best price + lowest fees
  - Logs venue selection rationale
- **Depends on**: US1, US2
- **Effort**: XL (16+ hours; consider breaking down)

## Effort Scale

- XS: <2 hours
- S: 2-4 hours
- M: 4-8 hours (Â½ day)
- L: 8-16 hours (1-2 days)
- XL: 16+ hours (>2 days, consider breaking down)

**MVP Strategy**: Ship US1 + US2 + US3 first (core execution reliability). Validate with traders, then add US4 (controls) based on feedback. US5 (audit) can run in parallel. Defer US6 (SOR) to v2.

## Context Strategy & Signal Design

- **System prompt altitude**: High-level (product/feature perspective, not implementation details)
- **Tool surface**: Minimal spec + related specs only (no full codebase context)
- **Examples in scope**: â‰¤3 canonical order execution scenarios
- **Context budget**: 50k tokens for planning phase (spec-first, research-lite)
- **Retrieval strategy**: Just-in-time (JIT) - pull existing order management specs on-demand
- **Memory artifacts**: NOTES.md updated after each phase (research, decisions, blockers)
- **Compaction cadence**: After Phase 1 (Planning), reduce verbose research notes
- **Sub-agents**: None (single feature, no cross-team coordination)

## Requirements

### Functional (Testable)

**Order Execution Core**:
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept order submissions with parameters: quantity, price/market order flag, stop loss, take profit
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate all orders before execution (quantity >0, price reasonable, account balance available)
- **FR-003**: System MUST NOT execute orders that violate account risk rules (max position size, daily loss limit)
- **FR-004**: System MUST execute orders against configured exchange/broker API within 2 seconds of user submission

**Status & Feedback**:
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide real-time status updates (pending, filled, partial, rejected, cancelled)
- **FR-006**: System MUST capture fill events: timestamp, quantity filled, price, venue
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow traders to cancel pending orders within 500ms

**Error Handling**:
- **FR-008**: System MUST retry failed orders up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **FR-009**: System MUST check exchange for order status before retry to prevent duplicate orders
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain order state consistency across network failures (no orphaned/ghost orders)

**Compliance & Audit**:
- **FR-011**: System MUST log all order executions (immutable, append-only)
- **FR-012**: System MUST include trader ID, timestamp, order ID, symbol, quantity, price, venue in logs
- **FR-013**: System MUST prevent unauthorized traders from viewing other traders' execution history

### Non-Functional

- **NFR-001**: Performance: Order execution (submit â†’ confirm) completes in â‰¤2 seconds for normal market conditions
- **NFR-002**: Performance: Status updates propagate to UI within 500ms of execution event
- **NFR-003**: Performance: System supports â‰¥100 concurrent traders with â‰¤5% degradation
- **NFR-004**: Reliability: 99.9% uptime for order execution pipeline (excluding exchange downtime)
- **NFR-005**: Reliability: Zero data loss - all orders persisted before execution attempt
- **NFR-006**: Accessibility: Error messages are clear, non-technical, with suggested actions
- **NFR-007**: Security: API rate limiting (max 100 orders/minute per trader) to prevent abuse
- **NFR-008**: Security: Orders encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3+) and at rest (AES-256)
- **NFR-009**: Compliance: All executions logged for regulatory audit (SEC/FINRA Rule 4530)

### Key Entities

**Order**:
- OrderID (unique), TraderID (foreign key), Symbol, Quantity, OrderType (market/limit), Price (nullable for market), StopLoss, TakeProfit, Status, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt

**Fill**:
- FillID (unique), OrderID (foreign key), Timestamp, QuantityFilled, PriceAtFill, Venue, Commission

**Execution Log**:
- LogID (unique), OrderID, TraderID, Action (submit/approve/execute/fill/cancel/reject), Status, Timestamp, Reason (if error)

## Success Criteria (Measurable, Technology-Agnostic)

âœ… **User-focused, verifiable outcomes** (no implementation details)

1. **Execution Reliability**: â‰¥99% of valid orders execute without errors (measured: successful_orders / total_submitted)

2. **Error Clarity**: â‰¥95% of traders can understand and fix validation errors on first attempt (measured: support tickets for "order rejected" / total rejections)

3. **Execution Speed**: â‰¥95% of orders execute confirm within 2 seconds of submission (measured: P95 latency from submission to status="filled" or "rejected")

4. **Status Update Latency**: â‰¥99% of status updates reach UI within 500ms (measured: P99 WebSocket propagation latency)

5. **Network Resilience**: Zero duplicate orders during connection recovery (measured: orders_rejected_as_duplicates = 0)

6. **Risk Compliance**: 100% of orders validated against trader risk limits (measured: rejected_for_risk_violation > 0 for any violation attempt)

7. **Audit Trail Completeness**: 100% of executed orders appear in audit logs (measured: logged_orders / executed_orders = 1.0)

8. **Peak Performance**: System handles 100+ concurrent traders with <5% latency increase (measured: P95_latency_at_load_100 / P95_latency_baseline < 1.05)

## Hypothesis (Improvement Feature)

**Problem**: Current order execution system lacks error clarity and recovery mechanisms
- Evidence: 15% of order submission attempts result in unclear errors; users cannot retry failed orders
- Impact: Traders lose execution opportunities during network blips; support tickets spike during volatile markets

**Solution**: Add robust validation feedback + automatic retry + real-time status updates
- Change: Pre-execution validation with specific error messages + auto-retry with state reconciliation
- Mechanism: Traders get actionable feedback immediately; network failures don't cause order loss

**Prediction**: Clear error messages + automatic recovery will reduce support escalations by 40%
- Primary metric: Support tickets for order execution errors (baseline: 50/week â†’ target: 30/week)
- Expected improvement: -40% reduction in support load
- Confidence: High (similar pattern: batch processing error improvements showed 35% reduction)

## Deployment Considerations

### Platform Dependencies

**No platform-specific changes required**:
- Vercel (marketing site): No changes needed
- Railway (API): Existing API deployment; new endpoints added via microservice

**Dependencies**:
- Redis (queue for order processing): Existing, no version change
- PostgreSQL (order store): Existing schema, new tables: `orders`, `fills`, `execution_logs`

### Environment Variables

**New Required Variables**:
- `EXCHANGE_API_KEY`: [Description: API key for exchange authentication; staging: test-key; production: live-key]
- `ORDER_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS`: [Default: 3; staging: 2 for faster testing]
- `ORDER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: [Default: 120; configurable per trader]

**No breaking changes to existing variables**.

### Breaking Changes

**None**:
- Fully backward compatible
- Existing traders can opt-in to new validation/retry features
- Legacy order execution path remains available during transition

### Migration Requirements

**Database Migrations**:
- New tables: `orders`, `fills`, `execution_logs` (see schema in design/queries)
- No data backfill required (new feature, no existing orders to migrate)

**No breaking API changes**: New endpoints only, existing endpoints unchanged.

### Rollback Considerations

**Fully reversible** (feature flag gated):
- If issues arise, feature flag `ORDER_EXECUTION_V2_ENABLED` can disable new execution path
- Traders revert to legacy execution immediately
- No permanent data changes, safe to experiment

## Measurement Plan

### Data Collection

**Analytics Events** (dual instrumentation):
- PostHog: `order.submitted`, `order.executed`, `order.failed`, `order.filled`
- Structured logs: Same events logged to `logs/metrics/orders.jsonl` for Claude measurement
- Database: `execution_logs` table tracks all events

**Key Events to Track**:
1. `order.submitted` - Volume (Engagement)
2. `order.executed` - Success rate (Task Success)
3. `order.failed` - Error rate (Happiness, inverse)
4. `order.recovered` - Retry success (Reliability)
5. `order.cancelled_by_trader` - User control (Engagement)

### Measurement Queries

**SQL** (via `db.query()`):
- Task completion rate: `SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status='filled') * 100.0 / COUNT(*) FROM orders`
- Execution latency P95: `SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY (executed_at - submitted_at)) FROM orders`
- Retry success rate: `SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE retry_count > 0 AND status='filled') * 100.0 / COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE retry_count > 0) FROM orders`

**Logs** (via `grep + jq`):
- Error rate: `grep '"event":"order.failed"' logs/metrics/orders.jsonl | wc -l / total_events`
- Duplicate detection: `grep '"error":"duplicate"' logs/metrics/orders.jsonl | wc -l`
