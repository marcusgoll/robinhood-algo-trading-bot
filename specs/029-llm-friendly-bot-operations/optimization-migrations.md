# Database Migration Validation Report
**Feature**: 029-llm-friendly-bot-operations
**Generated**: 2025-10-24 21:04:15
**Status**: SKIPPED (No database migrations required)

---

## Summary

This feature does **not require database migrations**. All data persistence uses file-based storage
(JSONL and YAML files) rather than database tables.

---

## Migration Files Found

**Count**: 0

**Expected**: 0

**Details**: No migration files were created for this feature because it uses file-based storage
exclusively.

### Existing Migrations in Project

The project has existing Alembic migrations unrelated to this feature:
- `api/alembic/versions/001_create_order_tables.py` (pre-existing, not related to feature 029)

### Search for Feature-Related Migrations

**Command**: `find api/alembic/versions -name "*.py" -newer specs/029-llm-friendly-bot-operations/plan.md`

**Result**: No migration files created after this feature's planning phase

## Storage Strategy Analysis

### File-Based Storage (No Database)

This feature uses the following file-based persistence:

| Entity | Storage Location | Format | Purpose |
|--------|------------------|--------|---------|
| **SemanticError** | `error_log.jsonl` | JSONL | Error logging with semantic context |
| **Workflow** | `config/workflows/*.yaml` | YAML | Workflow definitions (restart-bot, update-targets, etc.) |
| **WorkflowStep** | `config/workflows/*.yaml` | YAML | Individual workflow steps (embedded in Workflow) |
| **ConfigChange** | `config/config_history.jsonl` | JSONL | Configuration change audit trail |
| **WorkflowExecution** | `workflow_execution_log.jsonl` | JSONL | Workflow execution tracking |

### In-Memory Only (Not Persisted)

| Entity | Storage | Lifecycle |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **BotState** | In-memory cache (60s TTL) | Runtime aggregation from dashboard/performance modules |
| **BotSummary** | Derived on-demand | Generated from BotState, not stored |

### Rationale from Specification

From `specs/029-llm-friendly-bot-operations/plan.md`:

> **Database Migrations**: No migrations required (file-based storage for workflows and config
> history) (line 276)

> **Summary**: Entities: 6 (BotState, BotSummary, SemanticError, Workflow, WorkflowStep,
> ConfigChange) - Relationships: BotState aggregates dashboard data; BotSummary compresses for
> context optimization - **Migrations required: No (file-based storage for workflows and config
> history)** (line 124)

---

## Reversibility Status

**Status**: N/A (file-based storage is inherently reversible)

**Explanation**:
- No database migrations to reverse
- File-based storage can be rolled back by deleting or archiving JSONL/YAML files
- No database schema changes to undo

**Rollback Procedure** (from plan.md):
1. Stop API service (kills uvicorn process)
2. Revert code (`git checkout` previous commit)
3. Remove or archive JSONL/YAML files if needed
4. No database rollback required

---

## Schema Drift Status

**Status**: N/A (no database schema changes)

**Check Performed**:
```bash
cd api && uv run alembic check
```

**Result**: Check encountered environment error (os error 5) unrelated to this feature

**Conclusion**: Schema drift check is not applicable because this feature introduces **zero
database schema changes**. All persistence is file-based.

## Validation Checklist

- [x] **Migration plan checked**: No migration-plan.md found (expected for file-based storage)
- [x] **plan.md reviewed**: Explicitly states "No database migrations required"
- [x] **data-model.md reviewed**: All entities use JSONL or YAML storage
- [x] **Migration files searched**: No new migration files created
- [x] **Reversibility assessed**: N/A (file-based storage)
- [x] **Schema drift checked**: N/A (no database changes)

## Final Status

**STATUS**: **PASSED** (SKIPPED - No database migrations required)

**Reason**: Feature 029 (LLM-Friendly Bot Operations and Monitoring) is designed to use file-based
persistence exclusively. The feature adds API endpoints and services on top of existing bot
infrastructure without modifying the database schema.

### Why No Database Migrations?

1. **Additive Architecture**: Feature adds API layer on top of existing modules
2. **Reuses Existing Models**: Leverages dashboard and performance tracker data models
3. **File-Based Audit Trail**: Configuration changes logged to JSONL for simplicity
4. **Stateless APIs**: BotState and BotSummary are runtime aggregations, not persisted entities
5. **Workflow Definitions**: Stored as YAML files for easy editing without migrations

### Storage Trade-offs Considered

**Benefits of File-Based Storage**:
- No database migration complexity
- Easy to inspect and debug (plain text files)
- Simple rollback (delete files)
- No schema version management overhead
- Suitable for low-volume data (errors, config changes)

**Limitations Accepted**:
- No complex querying (acceptable for audit logs)
- Manual log rotation needed (mitigated by structured logger)
- No ACID guarantees (acceptable for append-only logs)

---

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Log File Growth**: Implement log rotation for `error_log.jsonl`,
   `workflow_execution_log.jsonl`, and `config_history.jsonl`

2. **Backup JSONL Files**: Include JSONL/YAML files in backup strategy alongside database

3. **Future Consideration**: If audit trail queries become complex (e.g., "show all config changes
   by user X"), consider migrating to database with proper migration

4. **Documentation**: Update deployment docs to mention file-based storage requirements and log
   rotation strategy
