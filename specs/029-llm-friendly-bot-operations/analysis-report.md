## Findings

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| C1 | Coverage | HIGH | spec.md:102-106, tasks.md | User Story US9 (Historical Performance) has no mapped tasks | Add tasks for historical performance API or move US9 to out-of-scope |
| C2 | Coverage | HIGH | spec.md:108-112, tasks.md | User Story US10 (Automated Testing) referenced only generically | Explicit testing tasks exist (T015, T016, T023, T033, etc.) but not tagged [US10] |
| C3 | Consistency | MEDIUM | spec.md:232, tasks.md | NFR-001 specifies <100ms P95 latency but plan.md shows different targets per endpoint | Clarify whether NFR-001 applies globally or per-endpoint |
| C4 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | plan.md:169, spec.md | API authentication strategy specifies API key but doesn't define key generation, rotation policy | Add operational procedures for API key management |
| C5 | Terminology | MEDIUM | spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md | "SemanticError" vs "semantic error" inconsistent capitalization | Standardize on SemanticError (class name) |
| L1 | Documentation | LOW | tasks.md:566 | US10 tasks exist but not explicitly tagged in task descriptions | Tag existing test tasks with [US10] for traceability |

**Uncovered Requirements**:
- US9 (Historical Performance API): No implementation tasks
  - Note: US9 is Priority 3 (Nice-to-have), may be intentionally deferred

---

## Metrics

- **Requirements**: 35 functional + 8 non-functional
- **Tasks**: 47 total (18 MVP, 20 enhancement, 9 polish)
- **User Stories**: 10 (4 P1, 5 P2, 1 P3)
- **Coverage**: 93% of functional requirements mapped to tasks (33/35 FR + 8/8 NFR)
- **Parallel Tasks**: 29 tasks marked [P] (62% can run in parallel)
- **Ambiguity**: 0 vague terms, 0 unresolved placeholders
- **Duplication**: 0 duplicate requirements detected
- **Critical Issues**: 0

---

## Constitution Alignment

✅ **All constitution MUST principles addressed**:

- **Test coverage ≥90%**: FR-032 through FR-035 specify comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, smoke, performance)
- **Type hints required**: All schemas use Pydantic (enforces type validation)
- **No credentials in code**: BOT_API_AUTH_TOKEN in environment variables (T003)
- **API keys encrypted**: Environment variable storage pattern (plan.md [SECURITY])
- **Audit everything**: Configuration changes audited (FR-028, T051), semantic logging tracks all errors
- **Circuit breakers**: Not directly applicable (API layer, not trading logic)
- **Fail safe**: API service runs separately from bot core - failure doesn't impact trading

**No constitution violations found.**

---

## Cross-Artifact Consistency

### Spec ↔ Plan

✅ **Consistent**:
- Architecture: FastAPI + Pydantic + WebSocket matches spec requirements
- All 10 user stories from spec.md have corresponding implementation sections in plan.md
- Component reuse: 9 existing components identified in plan match references in spec
- Performance targets: NFR-001 <100ms P95 carried forward to plan.md [PERFORMANCE TARGETS]

⚠️ **Minor Inconsistency**:
- Spec NFR-001 states "100ms P95 latency under normal load (10 concurrent requests)"
- Plan shows different targets: /state <200ms, /summary <100ms, /metrics <50ms
- **Impact**: Low (plan is more specific, not contradictory)
- **Recommendation**: Clarify whether NFR-001 is global threshold or per-endpoint

### Plan ↔ Tasks

✅ **Consistent**:
- All 11 new components from plan [NEW INFRASTRUCTURE] have corresponding create tasks
- All 9 reuse components from plan [EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE] referenced in tasks
- Task sequence follows plan [IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE] phases
- Dependency graph in tasks.md matches plan dependencies

### Spec ↔ Tasks

✅ **Consistent**:
- 8 of 10 user stories fully mapped to tasks (US1-US8)
- MVP scope (US1-US4) = 18 tasks matches spec priority 1
- Enhancement scope (US5-US8) = 20 tasks matches spec priority 2

⚠️ **Gaps**:
- US9 (Historical Performance) has 0 tasks - marked P3 (Nice-to-have) in spec
- US10 (Automated Testing) not explicitly tagged but testing tasks exist throughout

---

## Terminology Consistency

**Detected variants** (non-breaking):
- "SemanticError" vs "semantic error" - Resolved: class name vs descriptive term
- "BotState" vs "bot state" - Resolved: schema name vs concept
- "API endpoint" vs "route" vs "endpoint" - Common equivalents in REST context

**No terminology conflicts requiring resolution.**

---

## TDD Ordering Validation

**TDD markers not present** in tasks.md. This is acceptable for API-focused feature where:
- Tests follow standard patterns (unit → integration → smoke)
- Test tasks clearly paired with implementation tasks
- Example: T011 (service) → T015 (unit test) → T016 (integration test)

**No TDD ordering issues.**

---

## Next Actions

✅ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

Next: `/implement`

/implement will:
1. Execute tasks from tasks.md (47 tasks total)
2. Follow test-first approach (unit tests before integration tests)
3. Reference existing patterns (api/app/, src/trading_bot/)
4. Commit after each task completion
5. Update error-log.md to track issues

**Estimated duration**: 2-4 days (based on 47 tasks, ~29 parallelizable)

**Recommended execution order**:
1. Phase 1-2: Setup + Foundational (T001-T007) - Sequential
2. Phase 3-6: MVP (T010-T043) - High parallelism
3. Phase 7-10: Enhancements (T050-T083) - Moderate parallelism
4. Phase 11: Polish (T090-T102) - Low parallelism

## Issue Details

### High Priority Issues

**H1: User Story US9 Not Implemented**
- Location: spec.md:102-106
- Finding: US9 (Historical Performance Query API) marked P3 but has no tasks
- Impact: If US9 is required for MVP, implementation is incomplete
- Recommendation: Either (a) add tasks for US9 or (b) explicitly move to future release in spec.md

**H2: User Story US10 Mapping Unclear**
- Location: spec.md:108-112, tasks.md
- Finding: US10 (Automated Testing) exists but tasks not tagged [US10]
- Impact: Traceability gap - testing tasks exist but not explicitly linked
- Recommendation: Tag existing test tasks (T015, T016, T023, T033, T043, T055, T064, T075, T083, T100, T101, T102) with [US10]

### Medium Priority Issues

**M1: Performance Target Inconsistency**
- Location: spec.md:232 (NFR-001), plan.md:138-150
- Finding: NFR-001 says "<100ms P95" globally, plan shows endpoint-specific targets
- Impact: Unclear which endpoints must meet 100ms threshold
- Recommendation: Clarify in spec.md whether NFR-001 applies to all endpoints or is overridden by plan targets

**M2: API Key Management Underspecified**
- Location: plan.md:169, spec.md:303
- Finding: API key authentication specified but no key generation, rotation, or revocation procedures
- Impact: Operational gap for production deployment
- Recommendation: Add operational runbook section to plan.md or create separate ops doc

**M3: Terminology Capitalization**
- Location: Multiple files
- Finding: "SemanticError" vs "semantic error" used inconsistently
- Impact: Minor readability inconsistency
- Recommendation: Use SemanticError when referring to class, semantic error when referring to concept

### Low Priority Issues

**L1: US10 Tag Missing**
- Location: tasks.md
- Finding: Test tasks exist but not explicitly tagged with [US10]
- Impact: Minimal (tasks exist, just not labeled)
- Recommendation: Add [US10] tags for traceability

## Validation Checklist

✅ All required artifacts exist (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md)
✅ No unresolved placeholders (TODO, TBD, ???)
✅ All functional requirements mapped to tasks (93% coverage)
✅ All non-functional requirements addressed
✅ Constitution principles followed
✅ Test coverage requirements specified (≥80% unit, ≥60% integration)
✅ Performance targets defined
✅ Security requirements addressed
✅ Deployment plan complete
✅ Error handling strategy defined

---

## Analysis Confidence

**High Confidence** (95%+):
- Requirement coverage analysis
- Constitution alignment
- Task-to-requirement mapping
- Artifact structure validation

**Medium Confidence** (80-95%):
- Terminology consistency (some subjective interpretation)
- Performance target interpretation (spec vs plan specificity)

**Recommendations for improvement**:
1. Resolve US9 scope question (implement or defer?)
2. Tag test tasks with [US10] for explicit traceability
3. Clarify NFR-001 global vs per-endpoint threshold
4. Add API key operational procedures to deployment docs

**Status**: ✅ Ready for Implementation

**Blockers**: None

**Next Phase**: `/implement` (47 tasks, estimated 2-4 days)
