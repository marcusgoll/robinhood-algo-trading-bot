# Tasks: Daily Profit Goal Management

## [CODEBASE REUSE ANALYSIS]
Scanned: src/trading_bot/**/*.py, tests/unit/**/*.py

[EXISTING - REUSE]
- ✅ PerformanceTracker (src/trading_bot/performance/tracker.py)
- ✅ SafetyChecks (src/trading_bot/safety_checks.py)
- ✅ StructuredTradeLogger (src/trading_bot/logging/structured_logger.py)
- ✅ TradeRecord dataclass pattern (src/trading_bot/logging/trade_record.py)
- ✅ Config dual loading (src/trading_bot/config.py)
- ✅ PerformanceSummary models (src/trading_bot/performance/models.py)

[NEW - CREATE]
- 🆕 ProfitGoalConfig dataclass (no existing profit goal config)
- 🆕 DailyProfitState dataclass (no existing profit state tracking)
- 🆕 ProfitProtectionEvent dataclass (no existing protection events)
- 🆕 DailyProfitTracker service (no existing profit tracking orchestrator)
- 🆕 ProfitProtectionLogger (new JSONL logger for protection events)

## [DEPENDENCY GRAPH]
Story completion order:
1. Phase 1: Setup (non-blocking infrastructure)
2. Phase 2: Foundational (blocks all stories - core models and config)
3. Phase 3: US1 [P1] - Configure daily profit target (independent)
4. Phase 4: US2 [P1] - Track daily P&L (depends on US1 config)
5. Phase 5: US3 [P1] - Detect profit giveback (depends on US2 tracking)
6. Phase 6: Polish & Integration (depends on US1-US3)

## [PARALLEL EXECUTION OPPORTUNITIES]
- Phase 2: T005, T006, T007 (different model files, no dependencies)
- Phase 3: T011, T012 (config tests can run in parallel)
- Phase 4: T015, T016 (tracker tests for different aspects)
- Phase 5: T020, T021, T022 (logger and integration tests)
- Phase 6: T030, T031, T032 (polish tasks in different files)

## [TEST GUARDRAILS]

**Speed Requirements:**
- Unit tests: <2s each
- Integration tests: <10s each
- Full suite: <6 min total

**Coverage Requirements:**
- New code: 100% coverage (no untested lines in new features per spec.md NFR-005)
- Unit tests: ≥90% line coverage (from spec.md NFR-005)
- Integration tests: ≥80% coverage of critical paths
- Modified code: Coverage cannot decrease

**Measurement:**
- Python: `pytest --cov=src/trading_bot/profit_goal --cov-report=term-missing tests/unit/profit_goal/`
- Target: All new lines in src/trading_bot/profit_goal/ must be covered

**Quality Gates:**
- All tests must pass before merge
- Coverage thresholds enforced in CI
- No skipped tests without GitHub issue

**Clarity Requirements:**
- One behavior per test
- Descriptive names: `test_protection_triggers_when_drawdown_exceeds_threshold()`
- Given-When-Then structure in test body

**Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ NO UI snapshots (not applicable - backend feature)
- ❌ NO implementation testing (test behaviors, not internals)
- ✅ USE mock for external dependencies (PerformanceTracker, file I/O)
- ✅ USE real dataclasses for validation testing

**Examples:**
```python
# ❌ Bad: Testing implementation detail
assert tracker._state.daily_pnl == Decimal("100")

# ✅ Good: Testing behavior
state = tracker.get_current_state()
assert state.daily_pnl == Decimal("100")

# ❌ Bad: Generic error message
assert result is False

# ✅ Good: Descriptive assertion
assert tracker.is_protection_active() is True, \
    "Protection should activate when drawdown exceeds 50%"
```
