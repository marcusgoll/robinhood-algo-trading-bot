## Findings

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| C1 | Consistency | MEDIUM | spec.md:8, tasks.md:255 | Market open time inconsistency: spec assumes 4:00 AM EST reset but tasks reference "market open detection" without explicit time | Clarify in tasks.md that market open = 4:00 AM EST per spec assumptions |
| C2 | Coverage | MEDIUM | spec.md:161-169, tasks.md | Environment variable validation not explicitly tested: PROFIT_TARGET_DAILY and PROFIT_GIVEBACK_THRESHOLD mentioned in spec but no dedicated validation test task | Add test task for env var validation or document as part of T012 |
| L1 | Documentation | LOW | tasks.md:398 | Test coverage requirement states 100% for new code but spec.md NFR-005 states >=90% | Align test coverage expectations (>=90% is acceptable per spec) |

## Constitution Alignment

### Safety_First

- Circuit breakers: Profit protection extends SafetyChecks circuit breaker pattern
- Fail safe design: Protection blocks entries but allows exits (FR-007)
- Audit everything: All protection triggers logged to JSONL (FR-009)
- Tested before production: >=90% test coverage required (NFR-005)

### Code_Quality

- Type hints: T040 ensures mypy --strict compliance (NFR-006)
- Test coverage >=90%: Explicit guardrails in tasks.md [TEST GUARDRAILS]
- One function, one purpose: DailyProfitTracker.update_state delegates to specialized methods
- No duplicate logic: Reuses PerformanceTracker for P&L (avoids duplication)

### Risk_Management

- Position sizing: Not applicable (feature is profit protection, not position sizing)
- Stop losses: Not applicable (profit protection is complementary)
- Validate all inputs: ProfitGoalConfig validation in __post_init__ (T013)
- Rate limit protection: Not applicable (local-only feature)

### Security

- No credentials in code: Uses env vars for config (PROFIT_TARGET_DAILY)
- No PII stored: Only monetary values and timestamps (plan.md [SECURITY])

### Data_Integrity

- Validate market data: Reuses PerformanceTracker validation
- Handle missing data: Error handling in T035, T036
- Time zone awareness: pytz for Eastern timezone with DST handling (T032)
- Data retention: JSONL daily rotation follows existing patterns

### Testing_Requirements

- Unit tests: 9 dedicated test tasks (T011, T012, T015-T017, T021-T023)
- Integration tests: 3 integration test tasks (T045-T047)
- Coverage: >=90% enforced (tasks.md line 358)

**Constitution Violations**: 0

All MUST principles from constitution.md are addressed in spec, plan, or tasks.

---

## Architecture Consistency

### Design Pattern Adherence

- Dataclass + Validation: All models (T005-T007) follow TradeRecord pattern
- Dependency Injection: DailyProfitTracker receives PerformanceTracker (T018)
- Circuit Breaker Extension: SafetyChecks integration (T027) follows existing pattern
- File-Based State: JSON for state, JSONL for events (T020, T026)

### Component Reuse Validation

From plan.md [EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE - REUSE]:
- PerformanceTracker: Referenced in T016, T018, T019
- SafetyChecks: Extended in T022, T027
- StructuredTradeLogger: Pattern followed in T023, T025, T026
- TradeRecord pattern: Applied in T005, T006, T007
- Config dual loading: Applied in T008, T014
- PerformanceSummary models: Pattern followed in T005-T007

All 6 components marked for reuse are explicitly referenced in tasks.

### New Infrastructure Validation

From plan.md [NEW INFRASTRUCTURE - CREATE]:
- models.py: Created in T005-T007 (3 dataclasses)
- tracker.py: Created in T018-T020, T024, T031-T032 (DailyProfitTracker)
- logger.py: Created in T025-T026 (ProfitProtectionLogger)
- config.py: Created in T008, T014 (config loader)
- SafetyChecks integration: Modified in T027

All 5 components marked for creation are explicitly tasked.

---

## Data Model Consistency

### Entity Field Validation

**ProfitGoalConfig** (data-model.md vs tasks.md):
- Fields: target, threshold, enabled
- Validation: T013 implements range checks ($0-$10k, 10%-90%)
- Consistency: PASS

**DailyProfitState** (data-model.md vs tasks.md):
- Fields: 8 fields as specified (session_date, daily_pnl, realized_pnl, unrealized_pnl, peak_profit, protection_active, last_reset, last_updated)
- Validation: T006 implements __post_init__ validation
- Persistence: T017, T020 implement JSON persistence
- Consistency: PASS

**ProfitProtectionEvent** (data-model.md vs tasks.md):
- Fields: 8 fields as specified (event_id, timestamp, session_date, peak_profit, current_profit, drawdown_percent, threshold, session_id)
- Validation: T007 implements validation rules
- Logging: T023, T026 implement JSONL logging
- Consistency: PASS

---

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Test Task Distribution

- Model tests: 3 tasks (T011, T012, T015-T017, T021-T023) - 9 total
- Integration tests: 3 tasks (T045-T047)
- Error handling tests: Implicit in T017, T036
- Total test tasks: 12 explicit test tasks

### Coverage Gaps (Potential)

1. Dashboard integration test: FR-012 requires status exposure, but no explicit dashboard test
   - Mitigation: Assumed via existing dashboard dependency
   - Severity: LOW (documented assumption in spec.md)

2. Environment variable edge cases: Missing explicit test for malformed env vars
   - Coverage: T012 tests env var loading but not all edge cases
   - Severity: MEDIUM (documented in findings table as C2)

### TDD Ordering Validation

- TDD markers present: 0 (no [RED], [GREEN], [REFACTOR] markers in tasks.md)
- Test-first approach: Tests written before implementation in all phases
- Ordering: Tests (T011, T012) â†’ Implementation (T013, T014) pattern followed
- Compliance: PASS (test-first without explicit TDD markers is acceptable)

---

## Risk Analysis

### Risks from plan.md [RISK MITIGATION]

| Risk | Mitigation Task | Status |
|------|----------------|--------|
| State file corruption during crash | T036 (corruption recovery) | TASKED |
| P&L calculation drift | T016 (consistency assertion) | TASKED |
| Timezone issues with market open | T030, T032 (DST handling) | TASKED |
| Protection triggers on small profits | T021 (threshold logic test) | TASKED |

- Reversibility: Fully reversible (delete files, remove config, restart)

**Rollback Plan**: COMPLETE

---

## Metrics & Measurement

### HEART Metrics Validation

All 5 HEART metrics defined in spec.md have measurable sources:
- Happiness: `logs/profit-protection/*.jsonl` queries
- Engagement: `logs/trades/*.jsonl` via TradeQueryHelper
- Adoption: Config compliance rate from profit_goal_config
- Retention: Losing streak analysis from trade logs
- Task Success: Protection trigger accuracy from event logs

**Measurement Plan**: COMPLETE

### Data Collection Validation

## Next Actions

**READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

Next: `/implement`

/implement will:
1. Execute tasks from tasks.md (36 tasks across 6 phases)
2. Follow TDD where applicable (tests before implementation)
3. Reference existing patterns (PerformanceTracker, SafetyChecks, TradeRecord)
4. Commit after each task completion
5. Update error-log.md to track issues

**Estimated Duration**: 12-16 hours (per tasks.md effort estimates)

**Recommended Approach**:
1. Start with Phase 1-2 (setup + foundational models) - 2 hours
2. Implement MVP (Phase 3-5: US1-US3) - 8-10 hours
3. Polish and integration (Phase 6) - 2-4 hours
4. Run full test suite and verify >=90% coverage

**No Blockers**: All critical issues resolved, ready to proceed.

---

## Issue Resolution Status

### Medium Issues

**C1 (Market open time inconsistency)**:
- Status: MINOR - Spec clearly states 4:00 AM EST in assumptions (line 269)
- Resolution: Tasks.md references "market open detection" which is defined in spec
- Action: Optional clarification comment in T032, not blocking

**C2 (Environment variable validation test)**:
- Status: MINOR - T012 includes "invalid values" test case (line 112)
- Resolution: Validation is covered, just not as dedicated task
- Action: Verify T012 includes malformed env var edge cases during implementation

### Low Issues

**L1 (Test coverage discrepancy)**:
- Status: DOCUMENTATION - Spec NFR-005 is authoritative (>=90%)
- Resolution: Tasks.md line 358 is aspirational ("100% for new code")
- Action: Follow spec requirement (>=90%), 100% is stretch goal

**All Issues**: Non-blocking, can be addressed during implementation or ignored.

---
