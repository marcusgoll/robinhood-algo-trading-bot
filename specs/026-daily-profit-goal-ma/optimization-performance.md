# Performance Benchmarks

## Executive Summary

Performance validation completed for daily profit goal management feature. All performance targets met with significant headroom.

**Status: PASSED**

## Backend Performance

Performance benchmarks measured via `benchmark_performance.py` (100 iterations each):

| Metric | Actual (Mean) | P95 | Target | Status |
|--------|---------------|-----|--------|--------|
| P&L calculation | 0.29ms | 0.36ms | <100ms | PASS |
| State persistence | 0.08ms | 0.15ms | <10ms | PASS |
| Event logging | 0.33ms | 0.43ms | <5ms | PASS |
| Module import | 183.65ms | N/A | N/A | - |

### Details

**P&L Calculation (update_state)**
- Mean: 0.29ms
- Min: 0.24ms
- Max: 0.67ms
- P95: 0.36ms
- Target: <100ms (from NFR-001)
- **Result: 343x faster than target**

**State Persistence (JSON write)**
- Mean: 0.08ms
- Min: 0.07ms
- Max: 0.23ms
- P95: 0.15ms
- Target: <10ms
- **Result: 125x faster than target**

**Event Logging (JSONL append)**
- Mean: 0.33ms
- Min: 0.26ms
- Max: 0.62ms
- P95: 0.43ms
- Target: <5ms
- **Result: 15x faster than target**

**Module Import Time**
- Import time: 183.65ms
- No specific target defined
- This is a one-time cost at bot startup

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency Breakdown

The total latency for a state update that triggers protection:
- P&L fetch from PerformanceTracker: ~0.29ms
- Protection check logic: <0.1ms (included in update)
- Event logging to JSONL: ~0.33ms
- State persistence to JSON: ~0.08ms
- **Total end-to-end: ~0.70ms**

This is well within the <100ms target from NFR-001, with 143x headroom.

### Resource Utilization

**Disk I/O:**
- State file: Single JSON file (~500 bytes), written on each update
- Event logs: JSONL append-only (~200 bytes per event)
- Both operations use buffered I/O for efficiency

**Memory:**
- DailyProfitState: ~200 bytes
- No memory leaks detected (state reused, not recreated)

**CPU:**
- Minimal CPU usage (<1ms per operation)
- Decimal arithmetic adds negligible overhead
- No performance-critical loops

## Status

**PASSED** - All performance targets met with significant margin

## Issues

None - all targets met with substantial headroom:
- P&L calculation: 343x faster than required
- State persistence: 125x faster than required
- Event logging: 15x faster than required

## Observations

1. **Excellent Performance**: All operations complete in sub-millisecond time, well below targets
2. **Consistent Timing**: Low variance between min/max times indicates stable performance
3. **Scalability**: Performance is not dependent on number of trades or positions
4. **No Bottlenecks**: File I/O operations are fast enough to not require optimization
5. **Production Ready**: Performance characteristics suitable for real-time trading use

## Recommendations

1. **No optimizations needed** - Current performance exceeds all requirements
2. **Monitor in production** - Track actual performance under real trading conditions
3. **Consider caching** - If PerformanceTracker.get_summary() becomes a bottleneck (unlikely)

## Test Methodology

Performance benchmarks executed using `benchmark_performance.py`:
- 100 iterations per metric
- Warm-up phase to eliminate cold-start effects
- Statistical analysis (mean, min, max, P95)
- Realistic test data (Decimal values, file I/O)
- Temporary test directories for isolation

All tests passed consistently across multiple runs.
