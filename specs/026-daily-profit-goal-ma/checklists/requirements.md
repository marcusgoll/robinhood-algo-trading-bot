# Specification Quality Checklist: Daily profit goal management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: specs/026-daily-profit-goal-ma/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Focused on requirements only
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs - Clear profit protection value proposition
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders - Plain language user scenarios
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed - User scenarios, requirements, success metrics, deployment

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3) - 0 markers, all assumptions documented
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous - All FRs have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable - HEART metrics with specific SQL queries
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - User-focused metrics only
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined - 4 primary scenarios with edge cases
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified - 4 edge cases documented (gaps, partial fills, overrides, timezone)
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded - Out of scope section defines 6 exclusions
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified - Dependencies on 4 shipped features, 6 assumptions listed

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - 12 FRs with MUST statements
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows - 6 user stories (3 MVP, 2 enhancement, 1 nice-to-have)
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - HEART framework with targets
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification - Technology-agnostic throughout

## Notes

**Status**: All checklist items passing (16/16 complete)

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear integration with existing shipped features (performance-tracking, safety-checks, trade-logging)
2. Comprehensive edge case analysis (market gaps, partial fills, timezone handling)
3. Measurable success criteria with specific SQL queries for validation
4. Well-scoped MVP with clear enhancement path (US1-US3 → US4-US6)
5. Constitution compliance verified (§Risk_Management, §Safety_First, §Audit_Everything)

**Ready for Planning**: Yes - Specification is complete and validated
**Next Phase**: /plan (design artifacts, architecture decisions, implementation strategy)
