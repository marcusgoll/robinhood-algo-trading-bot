# Feature Specification: Position Scaling & Phase Progression

**Branch**: `feature/022-pos-scale-progress`
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Draft
**Area**: strategy
**From Roadmap**: Yes (Impact: 5, Effort: 3, Confidence: 0.8, Score: 1.33)
**Dependencies**: performance-tracking âœ…, safety-checks âœ…, backtesting-engine âœ…

## User Scenarios

### Primary User Story
As a trading bot operator, I need a phase-based progression system that prevents me from scaling position sizes too quickly, enforces mandatory profitability gates between phases, and tracks my trading consistency so I can safely progress from paper trading to small live positions to full-scale trading.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I'm in Experience phase (paper trading only), **When** I attempt to switch to Proof of Concept phase, **Then** the system blocks the switch until I have completed 20+ profitable simulated sessions with win rate â‰¥60% and average R:R â‰¥1.5, and logs the validation result.

2. **Given** I'm in Proof of Concept phase (1 trade/day max, $100 position size), **When** I successfully place a trade, **Then** the system blocks additional trades for 24 hours and logs a countdown message showing when the next trade is allowed.

3. **Given** I'm in Real Money Trial phase with 10 consecutive profitable sessions, **When** the phase progression validator runs, **Then** it automatically suggests advancing to Scaling phase with increased position size ($200 â†’ $500) and logs the recommendation with supporting metrics.

4. **Given** I'm in Scaling phase with gradually increasing position sizes, **When** my rolling 20-trade win rate drops below 55%, **Then** the system automatically downgrades me to Trial phase, reduces position size by 50%, and triggers a circuit breaker requiring manual acknowledgment.

5. **Given** I'm in any phase with active positions, **When** I attempt to manually override the phase restrictions, **Then** the system blocks the override (except for emergency exits), logs the attempt, and displays the current phase constraints.

6. **Given** I complete 100 trades in Scaling phase with consistent profitability (win rate â‰¥65%, R:R â‰¥2.0), **When** the phase evaluator runs, **Then** it maintains Scaling phase status and continues gradual position size increases up to configured maximum.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if profitability degrades mid-phase? â†’ Automatic downgrade to previous phase with 50% position size reduction and circuit breaker activation
- How are phase transitions recorded? â†’ Log each transition with timestamp, metrics snapshot, and reason in `logs/phase-history.jsonl`
- What if session count is reset? â†’ Prevent reset without manual override + administrator password confirmation
- How are emergency exits handled? â†’ Always permitted regardless of phase restrictions, logged separately as emergency actions
- What if user tries to skip phases? â†’ Blocked - must progress sequentially through all phases (Experience â†’ PoC â†’ Trial â†’ Scaling)

## User Stories (Prioritized)

> **Purpose**: Break down feature into independently deliverable stories for MVP-first delivery.

## Success Metrics (HEART Framework)

> **Purpose**: Define quantified success criteria using Google's HEART framework.
> **Constraint**: All metrics MUST be measurable via logs, config files, and performance data.

| Dimension | Goal | Signal | Metric | Target | Guardrail |
|-----------|------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Happiness** | Prevent premature scaling losses | Capital preservation events | `phase.downgrade` events per month | â‰¤1/month after stabilization | >3/month triggers strategy review |
| **Engagement** | Encourage long-term discipline | Phase adherence duration | Average days per phase before advancement | Experience: 30 days, PoC: 60 days, Trial: 90 days | <15 days in any phase triggers compliance alert |
| **Adoption** | Enforce phase-based workflow | Manual override attempts | `phase.override_blocked` vs total trades | â‰¥98% blocked (only emergency exits allowed) | <95% triggers enforcement review |
| **Retention** | Sustain operator confidence | Continued bot usage after losses | Active trading days per month | â‰¥15 days/month | <10 days/month after losses suggests abandonment |
| **Task Success** | Achieve profitability before scaling | Phase advancement success rate | Operators reaching Scaling phase with profitability | â‰¥80% reach Scaling without major losses | <60% suggests criteria too lax |

**Performance Targets**:
- Phase validation check â‰¤50 ms (runs before each trade)
- Session profitability calculation â‰¤200 ms for 1,000 trades
- Phase history export â‰¤1 second for full trading history

## Hypothesis

**Problem**: Operators currently lack systematic progression controls, leading to premature scaling during winning streaks followed by capital loss during drawdowns. Manual discipline alone is insufficient.
- Evidence: Constitution Â§Safety_First emphasizes testing before real money, but no enforcement mechanism exists (specs/safety-checks/spec.md).
- Evidence: Performance tracking spec shows metrics exist but no automated progression gates (specs/performance-tracking/spec.md).
- Impact: Undisciplined operators risk significant capital loss by scaling before strategy validation.

**Solution**: Implement a mandatory four-phase progression system (Experience â†’ PoC â†’ Trial â†’ Scaling) with automated profitability validation, trade limits per phase, and downgrade mechanisms on poor performance.
- Change: New `PhaseManager` service with phase transition logic, profitability validators, and position size calculators
- Mechanism: Enforces Constitution Â§Safety_First and Â§Risk_Management through programmatic gates rather than operator discipline

**Prediction**: Phase-based progression will reduce premature scaling incidents from ~40% (estimated) to <5% by enforcing 60+ days of profitable trading before live scaling.
- Primary metric: Percentage of operators losing >10% capital in first 90 days drops from 40% to <5%
- Expected improvement: -87.5% capital loss incidents
- Confidence: High (based on industry best practices for prop trading firms)

## Context Strategy & Signal Design

- **System prompt altitude**: Service-level specification focused on phase state management, profitability validation, and trade enforcement contracts
- **Tool surface**: Python phase manager service, config validation, performance data queries, structured logging
- **Examples in scope**: (1) Phase transition validation, (2) Daily trade limit enforcement, (3) Automatic downgrade on losses
- **Context budget**: Target â‰¤40k tokens for implementation; compact NOTES.md after research
- **Retrieval strategy**: Upfront - load performance-tracking, safety-checks, backtesting-engine patterns
- **Memory artifacts**: NOTES.md updated after each major decision, TODO.md for task tracking
- **Compaction cadence**: After initial research, before planning phase
- **Sub-agents**: Backend implementation agent for phase logic, QA agent for validation testing

### Key Entities

**Phase** (enum):
- Values: Experience, ProofOfConcept, RealMoneyTrial, Scaling
- Current phase stored in `Config.trading_phase`
- Phase history logged in `logs/phase-history.jsonl`

**SessionMetrics** (dataclass):
- date: date
- phase: Phase
- trades_executed: int
- win_rate: Decimal
- average_rr: Decimal
- total_pnl: Decimal
- position_sizes: List[Decimal]
- circuit_breaker_trips: int

**PhaseTransition** (dataclass):
- timestamp: datetime (UTC)
- from_phase: Phase
- to_phase: Phase
- trigger: str (auto | manual)
- validation_passed: bool
- criteria: Dict[str, Any] (win_rate, rr, session_count, etc.)

## Deployment Considerations

### Platform Dependencies
None - Local-only feature (no remote services required)

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Phase override password (optional, for emergency manual changes)
PHASE_OVERRIDE_PASSWORD=<secure-password>

# Phase history log directory
PHASE_HISTORY_DIR=logs/phase/
```

### Breaking Changes
None - New feature, no existing phase system to replace

### Migration Required
No database migration - uses config file (`config.json`) and JSONL logs

### Rollback Considerations
Standard 3-command rollback:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
git push
# Restart bot
```

Phase history preserved in logs - rollback does not delete historical data

## Dependencies

**Completed Dependencies**:
- âœ… **performance-tracking**: Provides session metrics calculation (win rate, R:R, P&L)
- âœ… **safety-checks**: Provides circuit breaker infrastructure
- âœ… **backtesting-engine**: Provides historical validation for Experience phase

**Integration Points**:
- `TradingBot.execute_trade()` - Add phase validation check before trade execution
- `SafetyChecks.validate_trade()` - Integrate phase-specific limits (trade count, position size)
- `PerformanceTracker.generate_summary()` - Add session metrics to phase history
- `ModeSwitcher` - Enforce paper trading in Experience phase

## Success Criteria

> All criteria MUST be measurable, technology-agnostic, user-focused, and verifiable.

1. **Phase Enforcement**: System blocks 100% of out-of-phase trades (measured via logs: `phase.validation_blocked` events)

2. **Profitability Gates**: Operators cannot advance to next phase without meeting criteria (measured via: phase transition rejection rate â‰¥95% for non-qualifying operators)

3. **Trade Limits**: Proof of Concept phase enforces 1 trade per day with zero violations (measured via: `poc.daily_limit_exceeded` events = 0)

4. **Automatic Downgrade**: System downgrades phase within 1 minute of trigger condition (measured via: phase downgrade latency P95 <60 seconds)

5. **Capital Preservation**: Operators using phase system lose <5% capital in first 90 days vs >10% without system (measured via: P&L analysis in phase history)

6. **Session Tracking**: 100% of trading sessions recorded with profitability metrics (measured via: session count in `phase-history.jsonl` = actual trading days)

7. **Position Size Control**: Scaling phase enforces gradual increases with no sudden jumps >2x (measured via: position size deltas in session metrics)

8. **Override Protection**: Manual phase overrides blocked â‰¥98% of the time (emergency exits excluded) (measured via: `phase.override_blocked` / total override attempts)

## Assumptions

1. Operators will comply with manual restart requirements after circuit breaker trips
2. Trading sessions are defined as market open (7:00 AM) to market close (4:00 PM EST)
3. Profitability data from performance-tracking module is accurate and complete
4. Emergency exits are rare (<2% of all trades)
5. Operators using phase system will paper trade for minimum 30 days before live trading
6. Win rate and R:R targets are based on industry-standard profitable trading benchmarks
7. Position size increases are conservative enough to avoid significant capital risk

## Out of Scope

- Machine learning-based phase transition predictions
- Multi-strategy phase tracking (assumes single strategy per operator)
- Social comparison features (comparing phase progress across operators)
- Real-time phase progress dashboard (CLI-only in MVP)
- SMS/email alerts on phase transitions (logs only in MVP)
- Gamification features (badges, achievements for phase milestones)
