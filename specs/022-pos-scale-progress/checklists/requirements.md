# Requirements Quality Checklist

## Specification Completeness

- [x] **User Stories**: 6 user stories prioritized (US1-US6)
- [x] **Functional Requirements**: 8 requirements defined (FR-001 through FR-008)
- [x] **Non-Functional Requirements**: 4 requirements defined (NFR-001 through NFR-004)
- [x] **Success Criteria**: HEART metrics framework included
- [x] **Hypothesis**: Problem, solution, and outcomes documented

## Requirement Quality

- [x] **Testable**: All requirements have measurable acceptance criteria
- [x] **Unambiguous**: Clear definitions for phases, gates, and transitions
- [x] **Traceable**: User stories map to functional requirements
- [x] **Feasible**: Requirements align with existing codebase capabilities
- [x] **Constitution Compliance**: Mapped to §Safety_First, §Risk_Management, §Position_Sizing

## Phase Gate Clarity

- [x] **Experience → PoC**: 20 profitable sessions, 60% win rate, R:R ≥1.5
- [x] **PoC → Trial**: 30 days, 50 trades, 65% win rate, R:R ≥1.8
- [x] **Trial → Scaling**: 60 days, 100 trades, 70% win rate, R:R ≥2.0
- [x] **Downgrade Triggers**: Defined for each phase

## Edge Cases Considered

- [x] **Phase downgrades**: Automatic when profitability drops below thresholds
- [x] **State persistence**: phase_state.json for recovery
- [x] **Audit trail**: JSONL logging for all transitions
- [x] **Position size boundaries**: Min $200, max $2,000

## Integration Points

- [x] **Existing Risk Manager**: Extends risk_manager.py strategy
- [x] **Trade History**: Depends on metrics.py for profitability calculations
- [x] **Logging System**: Uses structured JSONL format
- [x] **Configuration**: Aligns with existing trading_parameters.json

## Validation Status

✅ **PASS**: Specification meets all quality criteria and is ready for planning phase.

**Reviewer Notes**: Comprehensive spec with clear phase definitions, measurable gates, and strong constitution alignment. Edge cases and safety mechanisms well documented.
