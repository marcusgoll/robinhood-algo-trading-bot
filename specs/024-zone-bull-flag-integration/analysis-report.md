### D. Task Breakdown Quality ✅

| Quality Gate | Status | Evidence |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| TDD ordering | ✅ Pass | All implementation tasks preceded by test tasks (US2: T005-T008 → T009; US1: T010-T012 → T013-T016; US3: T020-T022 → T023-T025) |

| Acceptance criteria | ✅ Pass | All 21 story tasks have independent test criteria linked to spec.md acceptance scenarios |
| Dependency tracking | ✅ Pass | tasks.md:22-28 documents completion order and blockers (US2 blocks US1, US1 blocks US3) |
| Parallel opportunities | ✅ Pass | 14 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution (tasks.md:30-34) |
| Effort estimation | ✅ Pass | plan.md:300-332 estimates 7-10 hours total (matches 28 tasks at ~15-20min each) |

**Finding**: Task breakdown follows TDD principles, has clear dependencies, and supports parallel execution.

---

### E. Performance Validation ✅

| Target | Requirement | Task Coverage | Status |
|--------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Zone detection | <50ms P95 | T012, T024 | ✅ Measured and enforced |
| Total calculation | <100ms P95 | T030 | ✅ P95 validation test |
| JSONL logging | <5ms P95 | Implied in FR-005 | ⚠️ Not explicitly tested (Low priority - logger is battle-tested) |

**Finding**: Core performance targets covered. JSONL logging performance not explicitly tested, but MomentumLogger is existing infrastructure (plan.md:162-164).

---

### F. Integration Risk Assessment ✅

| Risk | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| ZoneDetector unavailable | Optional dependency injection (T013), fallback logic (T020, T026) | ✅ Mitigated |
| Zone detection timeout | Timeout detection (T024), fallback to 2:1 target | ✅ Mitigated |
| Breaking existing bull flag logic | Backward compatibility tests (T033-T034), optional zone_detector | ✅ Mitigated |
| Decimal/float conversion errors | Decimal arithmetic enforced (plan.md:34-36), validation in TargetCalculation (T005-T006) | ✅ Mitigated |
| Missing test coverage | TDD approach, 90%+ coverage requirement (tasks.md:359-363) | ✅ Mitigated |

**Finding**: All identified risks have explicit mitigation strategies in tasks.

---

### G. Ambiguity Detection ✅

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Placeholder markers | ✅ Pass | No TODO, TKTK, ???, TBD, [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] found |

| Undefined components | ✅ Pass | All referenced components documented in plan.md [EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE] or [NEW INFRASTRUCTURE] |
| Unvalidated assumptions | ✅ Pass | Key assumptions documented (90% zone threshold to be validated via backtesting - spec.md:268) |

**Finding**: No ambiguities detected. Spec is implementation-ready.

---

### H. Duplication Detection ✅

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Duplicate requirements | ✅ Pass | No semantic overlap in FR-001 through FR-008 |
| Duplicate tasks | ✅ Pass | Each task has unique responsibility, no overlapping implementations |
| Reinventing existing code | ✅ Pass | tasks.md:3-16 documents 9 existing components to reuse (BullFlagDetector, ProximityChecker, ZoneDetector, Zone, MomentumLogger, BullFlagPattern, Decimal, MomentumConfig, MarketDataService) |
| Copy-paste patterns | ✅ Pass | plan.md:142-175 explicitly calls out reuse of existing patterns (BullFlagPattern for TargetCalculation, MomentumLogger for logging) |

**Finding**: Strong anti-duplication discipline. Reuse strategy clearly documented.

---

## Architecture Quality

### Strengths

1. **Clear separation of concerns**: TargetCalculation dataclass separates data from logic
2. **Graceful degradation**: Optional ZoneDetector dependency enables safe rollback
3. **Immutable data models**: frozen=True prevents audit trail corruption
4. **Decimal precision**: Financial calculations use Decimal (not float)
5. **Comprehensive error handling**: Fallback logic for all failure modes (unavailable, error, timeout)
6. **TDD discipline**: All implementation tasks preceded by tests
7. **Reuse existing infrastructure**: 9 existing components identified and leveraged
8. **Performance monitoring**: Explicit timing checks for zone detection (<50ms) and total calculation (<100ms)

### Design Patterns Identified

- **Dependency Injection**: Optional constructor parameter (plan.md:26-28)
- **Immutable Data Transfer Objects**: TargetCalculation dataclass (plan.md:180-185)
- **Separation of Concerns**: ProximityChecker for zone lookup, BullFlagDetector for pattern detection
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Fallback to 2:1 targets on any zone detection failure

## Performance Projections

| Metric | Target | Measurement Strategy | Risk |
|--------|--------|---------------------|------|
| Zone detection time | <50ms P95 | T012, T024 measure with time.perf_counter | Low (ZoneDetector is existing, tested code) |
| Total target calculation | <100ms P95 | T030 P95 validation over 100 samples | Low (simple arithmetic, minimal I/O) |
| JSONL logging overhead | <5ms P95 | Implied (MomentumLogger battle-tested) | Low (existing infrastructure) |
| Coverage rate | ≥90% line coverage | pytest --cov (tasks.md:366) | Low (TDD approach enforces coverage) |

**Projected Performance**: All targets achievable. No performance risks identified.
