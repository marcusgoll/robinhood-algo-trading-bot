# Specification Quality Checklist: Bull flag profit target integration with resistance zones

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: specs/024-zone-bull-flag-integration/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (0 markers)
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Summary**: All 16 checklist items passed. Specification is ready for planning phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear problem statement with evidence from manual review (30-40% targets hit resistance)
- Well-defined integration points (BullFlagDetector â†” ZoneDetector)
- Comprehensive edge case handling (multiple zones, weak zones, unavailable service)
- Graceful degradation strategy ensures backward compatibility
- Measurable success metrics (>5% win rate improvement target)
- Complete backtest validation plan

**Assumptions Documented**:
- 90% zone price threshold (to be validated via backtest)
- <50ms P95 zone detection performance
- 5% search range above entry price

**Next Phase**: /plan (no clarifications needed)
