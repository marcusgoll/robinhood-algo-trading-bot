### Functional Requirement Coverage

**High-level mapping** (FR -> US -> Tasks):
- FR-001 to FR-003: Large seller detection -> US1 -> T008-T015
- FR-004 to FR-007: Volume spike detection -> US2 -> T016-T023
- FR-008 to FR-009: Exit signals -> US3 -> T024-T028
- FR-010 to FR-012: Data validation -> US5 -> T032-T034
- FR-013: Position-only monitoring -> US3 -> T028

Note: While FRs are not explicitly referenced in task descriptions, all are covered through user story mapping.

## Constitution Alignment

### Principles Addressed

| Principle | Evidence | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Safety_First | Fail-fast validation (NFR-002), graceful degradation (T035) | Addressed |
| Data_Integrity | Timestamp validation (FR-010), price bounds (FR-011), validators.py module | Addressed |
| Audit_Everything | Structured JSONL logging (NFR-003), all alerts logged (T040) | Addressed |
| Risk_Management | Rate limiting (NFR-005), exponential backoff, position-only monitoring | Addressed |
| Code_Quality | Type hints required, dataclass pattern, 90%+ coverage target | Addressed |
| Testing_Requirements | 40 tasks include 11 test tasks, TDD approach, unit + integration tests | Addressed |

### Violations

None detected. All constitution MUST principles are addressed in the specification and implementation plan.

## Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Clear specification**: User stories have concrete acceptance criteria with Given-When-Then structure
2. **Full clarification**: All 3 critical ambiguities resolved in clarification session (Polygon.io API, positions-only monitoring)
3. **Proven patterns**: Zero architectural novelty - all patterns reused from existing codebase (CatalystDetector, MomentumConfig)
4. **TDD approach**: Test tasks precede implementation tasks for all user stories
5. **Parallelization**: 19 of 40 tasks marked for parallel execution (47.5% parallelizable)
6. **Comprehensive validation**: Dedicated validation module with timestamp, price, and sequence checks
7. **Strong error handling**: Graceful degradation, rate limiting, retry logic all specified

### Areas for Improvement

1. **FR-to-Task traceability**: While coverage exists through user stories, direct FR references in tasks would improve auditability
2. **Terminology standardization**: Minor inconsistencies in Level 2, Time & Sales, and Order Flow terminology across artifacts
3. **Component naming**: OrderFlowDetector not mentioned in spec (only in plan/tasks) - consider adding to spec §Key Entities
4. **Nice-to-have stories**: US6 and US7 deferred - ensure roadmap tracks these for future consideration

## Next Actions

**Ready for Implementation**

1. Review high-priority issue C1 (FR-to-task traceability)
   - Option A: Add FR references to task descriptions (recommended for audit trail)
   - Option B: Proceed with user story mapping (faster, still valid coverage)

2. Optional: Standardize terminology (Medium priority)
   - Can be addressed during implementation or skipped (semantic equivalence exists)

3. Proceed to `/implement`
   - Execute 40 tasks in 8 phases
   - Follow TDD workflow (RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR)
   - Target 90%+ test coverage
   - Estimated duration: 2-4 hours for MVP (US1-US3)

### Implementation Sequence

1. Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003) - 3 tasks
2. Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T007) - 4 tasks (3 parallelizable)
3. Phase 3: US1 Large Seller Detection (T008-T015) - 8 tasks
4. Phase 4: US2 Red Burst Detection (T016-T023) - 8 tasks
5. Phase 5: US3 Risk Management Integration (T024-T028) - 5 tasks
6. Phase 6-8: Enhancements & Polish (T029-T040) - 12 tasks

**MVP Stop Point**: After Phase 5 (T001-T028 = 28 tasks), feature is production-ready for paper trading validation.

## Constitution Compliance Checklist

- [x] Code_Quality: Type hints, dataclass pattern, 90%+ coverage
- [x] Risk_Management: Rate limiting, position sizing (positions-only monitoring)
- [x] Security: API key in env var, never logged
- [x] Data_Integrity: Timestamp validation, price bounds, chronological checks
- [x] Testing_Requirements: TDD approach, unit + integration tests, performance benchmarks
- [x] Stack: Python 3.11+, polygon-api-client, structured logging

## Summary

The Level 2 Order Flow Integration specification is **well-defined and ready for implementation**. All critical ambiguities have been resolved through clarification. The implementation plan leverages proven patterns from the existing codebase (zero architectural novelty), reducing implementation risk.

**One high-priority issue** (FR-to-task traceability) should be reviewed but does not block implementation, as coverage is verifiable through user story mapping.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/implement` with optional FR reference additions during task execution for improved audit trail.
