# Specification Quality Checklist: Level 2 order flow integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: specs/028-level-2-order-flow-i/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3) - **3 markers present (at limit)**
- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified
- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- 3 CRITICAL [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present (at maximum allowed):
  1. FR-001: Robinhood API Level 2 data availability
  2. FR-004: Robinhood API Time & Sales data availability
  3. FR-013: Monitoring scope (active positions only vs continuous watchlist)
- All markers prioritized by impact (scope > data availability > technical details)
- Specification is ready for /clarify phase to resolve these ambiguities
- All other quality gates passed - no blocking issues
