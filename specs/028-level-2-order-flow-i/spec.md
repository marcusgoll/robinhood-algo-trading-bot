# Feature Specification: Level 2 Order Flow Integration

**Branch**: `feature/028-level-2-order-flow-i`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft

## User Scenarios

### Primary User Story
A day trader running the trading bot wants to monitor real-time order flow to detect large institutional selling pressure (large seller alerts) and sudden volume spikes (red burst patterns) that indicate an imminent price drop, allowing the system to trigger protective exits before significant losses occur.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an active position in a stock, **When** a large sell order appears in the Level 2 order book (>10,000 shares at bid), **Then** the system logs a "large seller alert" with order size, price level, and timestamp
2. **Given** real-time Time & Sales data, **When** volume spikes >300% of 5-minute average with majority sells, **Then** the system logs a "red burst" alert and evaluates exit conditions
3. **Given** multiple large seller alerts within 2 minutes, **When** bid pressure builds (>3 consecutive large sells), **Then** the system triggers an exit signal for risk management evaluation
4. **Given** normal order flow conditions, **When** no large sellers or volume spikes detected, **Then** the system continues monitoring without alerts (no false positives)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Level 2 data feed is unavailable or delayed?
- How does system handle pre-market or after-hours order flow (different liquidity)?
- What if large orders appear on both bid and ask (institutional accumulation vs distribution)?
- How to distinguish between genuine selling pressure and market maker hedging?
- What happens during market-wide selloffs vs stock-specific events?

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-22

**Q1: Does Robinhood API provide Level 2 order book data? If not, what alternative data sources are available?**
- **Answer**: Robinhood API does not provide Level 2 data. Use Polygon.io API for professional-grade Level 2 order book data ($99/month starter plan). This provides reliable, retail-accessible data with good documentation.
- **Impact**: Adds Polygon.io API dependency and subscription cost. Requires API integration beyond existing robin_stocks usage.
- **Decision**: Proceed with Polygon.io as primary data source for Level 2 order book data.

**Q2: Does Robinhood API provide Time & Sales data? If not, what alternative is most cost-effective?**
- **Answer**: Use Polygon.io API for Time & Sales data (same provider as Level 2). This minimizes API complexity by using single provider and bundles costs effectively.
- **Impact**: No additional cost beyond Level 2 subscription. Simplifies API integration with consistent authentication and error handling.
- **Decision**: Use Polygon.io for both Level 2 and Time & Sales data.

**Q3: Should order flow monitoring be active only during active positions, or continuously for watchlist symbols?**
- **Answer**: Monitor order flow only for symbols with active positions. This reduces API usage/costs and focuses monitoring on risk management (exits) rather than entry signal generation.
- **Impact**: Lower API call volume, reduced costs, aligns with defensive trading strategy. May miss entry opportunities from order flow analysis.
- **Decision**: Active positions only. Can expand to watchlist monitoring in future enhancement if needed.

## User Stories (Prioritized)

> **Purpose**: Break down feature into independently deliverable stories for MVP-first delivery.
> **Format**: [P1] = MVP (ship first), [P2] = Enhancement, [P3] = Nice-to-have

    - Dashboard displays: active order flow alerts, alert count (last 5 minutes), largest seller detected
    - Color-coded alerts: yellow (single large seller), orange (multiple sellers), red (red burst)
    - Historical alert log (last 30 minutes)
  - **Depends on**: US1, US2, status-dashboard (shipped)
  - **Effort**: M (4-8 hours)

- **US7** [P3]: As a developer, I want order flow detection backtestable so that I can validate effectiveness of exit signals on historical data
  - **Acceptance**:
    - Backtest engine replays historical Level 2 data (if available)
    - Measures: alert accuracy (true positives vs false positives), exit timing improvement, drawdown reduction
    - Reports: average time from alert to price drop, percentage of profitable exits
  - **Depends on**: US1, US2, backtesting-engine (not yet shipped)

- XL: 16+ hours (>2 days, consider breaking down)

**MVP Strategy**: Ship US1-US3 first to establish order flow monitoring capability. Validate alert accuracy in paper trading before adding configurability (US4-US5) and visualization (US6).

## Success Metrics (HEART Framework)

> **Purpose**: Define quantified success criteria using Google's HEART framework.
> **Constraint**: All metrics MUST be Claude Code-measurable (SQL, logs, Lighthouse).

| Dimension | Goal | Signal | Metric | Target | Guardrail |
|-----------|------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Happiness** | Reduce unexpected losses | Exit before major drops | % positions exited before -5% drop | >60% early exit rate | <10% false positive exits |
| **Engagement** | Active monitoring | Alert frequency | Alerts logged per trading day | 5-15 alerts/day | <50 alerts/day (noise) |
| **Adoption** | Feature utilization | Exit signals triggered | % of exits using order flow data | >30% of exits cite order flow | >0% (feature must be used) |
| **Retention** | Continued use | Feature not disabled | Days feature remains active | 30+ consecutive days | 0 days disabled due to bugs |
| **Task Success** | Profitable exits | P&L improvement | Average exit P&L vs non-order-flow exits | +1.5% better exit timing | No worse than baseline |

**Performance Targets**:
- Alert latency: <2 seconds from data arrival to alert logged
- Data staleness: <10 seconds (fail if >30 seconds old)
- Memory usage: <50MB additional for order flow monitoring

**Measurement Plan**:
- **Logs**: `logs/order_flow/*.jsonl` - Alert counts, exit signals, latency
- **SQL**: `SELECT AVG(exit_pnl) FROM trades WHERE exit_reason='order_flow_alert'`
- **Comparison**: Baseline exits (stop loss only) vs order flow-assisted exits

## Context Strategy & Signal Design

- **System prompt altitude**: High-level strategy context - "Monitor order flow for institutional selling pressure to trigger protective exits"
- **Tool surface**: OrderFlowDetector.detect(), TapeMonitor.analyze_volume_spike(), essential for real-time analysis
- **Examples in scope**: 2 canonical examples (large seller alert, red burst pattern)
- **Context budget**: 8,000 tokens (alert detection is stateless, minimal context needed)
- **Retrieval strategy**: JIT - Fetch Level 2/Tape data only when position is active
- **Memory artifacts**: NOTES.md updated after each alert, logs/order_flow/*.jsonl for historical analysis
- **Compaction cadence**: Every 50 alerts (aggressive - order flow data is high-volume)
- **Sub-agents**: None (simple detector pattern, no sub-agent needed)

## Requirements

### Functional (testable only)

- **FR-001**: System MUST fetch Level 2 order book data from configured data source (Robinhood API or alternative)
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify sell orders exceeding configurable threshold (default: 10,000 shares) at bid or below
- **FR-003**: System MUST log large seller alerts with symbol, order size, price level, timestamp (UTC), alert severity
- **FR-004**: System MUST fetch Time & Sales data (tick-by-tick trades) from configured data source
- **FR-005**: System MUST calculate 5-minute rolling average volume from Time & Sales data
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect volume spikes exceeding configurable threshold (default: 300% of 5-min average) with >60% sell-side volume
- **FR-007**: System MUST log red burst alerts with symbol, magnitude, sell ratio, timestamp (UTC)
- **FR-008**: System MUST trigger exit signal when 3+ large seller alerts detected within configurable time window (default: 2 minutes)
- **FR-009**: System MUST trigger exit signal when red burst exceeds critical threshold (default: 400% volume spike)
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate Level 2 data freshness (timestamp <10 seconds old) before processing
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate Time & Sales data sequence (chronological order) and price bounds
- **FR-012**: System MUST gracefully degrade when Level 2/Tape data unavailable (log gap, continue with reduced monitoring)

- **FR-013**: System MUST monitor order flow only for symbols with active positions (not continuous watchlist monitoring). This reduces API usage and aligns with defensive risk management strategy

### Non-Functional

- **NFR-001**: Performance: Alert latency <2 seconds from data arrival to alert logged (P95)
- **NFR-002**: Reliability: Data validation errors MUST halt order flow monitoring (Constitution Â§Safety_First)
- **NFR-003**: Observability: All alerts MUST be logged to structured JSONL with UTC timestamps (Constitution Â§Audit_Everything)
- **NFR-004**: Configurability: Thresholds MUST be configurable via environment variables and config file
- **NFR-005**: Rate Limiting: API calls MUST respect data provider rate limits with exponential backoff (Constitution Â§Risk_Management)
- **NFR-006**: Memory Efficiency: Order flow monitoring MUST not exceed 50MB additional memory usage

### Key Entities (if data involved)

- **OrderFlowAlert**: Alert dataclass with fields: symbol, alert_type (large_seller|red_burst), severity (warning|critical), order_size, price_level, volume_ratio, timestamp_utc
- **OrderBookSnapshot**: Level 2 data with fields: symbol, bids (list of [price, size]), asks (list of [price, size]), timestamp_utc
- **TimeAndSalesRecord**: Tick data with fields: symbol, price, size, side (buy|sell), timestamp_utc
- **OrderFlowConfig**: Configuration with fields: large_order_size_threshold, volume_spike_threshold, red_burst_threshold, alert_window_seconds, data_source

**Railway** (API):
- None (local Python execution, not Railway-hosted)

**Dependencies**:
- **NEW**: Polygon.io SDK (polygon-api-client) - Level 2 order book and Time & Sales data
- **CLARIFIED**: robin_stocks library does NOT support Level 2/Tape data
- **NEW**: pandas-market-calendars (for market hours validation)

### Environment Variables

**New Required Variables**:
- `ORDER_FLOW_DATA_SOURCE`: Data provider - default: polygon (clarified: must be polygon, robinhood not supported)

- `ORDER_FLOW_ALERT_WINDOW_SECONDS`: Time window for consecutive alert detection (default: 120 seconds)
- `ORDER_FLOW_MONITORING_MODE`: Monitoring scope - default: positions_only (clarified: not continuous watchlist)

**Changed Variables**:
- None

**Schema Update Required**: Yes - Add order_flow section to config/config.schema.json in /plan phase

### Breaking Changes

**Data Backfill**:
- Not required (real-time monitoring only)

**RLS Policy Changes**:
- No (no database)

**Reversibility**:
- Fully reversible (remove ORDER_FLOW_* env vars, module gracefully skips when not configured)

### Rollback Considerations

**Standard Rollback**:
- Yes: 3-command rollback via git revert

## Measurement Plan

> **Purpose**: Define how success will be measured using Claude Code-accessible sources.
> **Sources**: SQL queries, structured logs, Lighthouse CI, database aggregates.

### Data Collection

**Analytics Events** (dual instrumentation):
- PostHog (dashboards): N/A (backend-only)
- Structured logs (Claude measurement): `logger.info({ event: "order_flow_alert", ...props })`
- Database (A/B tests): N/A (no database)

**Key Events to Track**:
1. `order_flow.large_seller_detected` - Large order detection
2. `order_flow.red_burst_detected` - Volume spike detection
3. `order_flow.exit_signal_triggered` - Exit recommendation
4. `order_flow.data_validation_error` - Data quality issue
5. `order_flow.alert_window_expired` - Alert cooldown

### Measurement Queries

**Logs** (`logs/order_flow/*.jsonl`):
- Alert frequency: `grep '"event":"order_flow_alert"' logs/order_flow/*.jsonl | wc -l`
- Exit signal count: `grep '"event":"order_flow.exit_signal_triggered"' logs/order_flow/*.jsonl | wc -l`
- False positive rate: `grep '"alert_followed_by_drop":false' logs/order_flow/*.jsonl | wc -l` / total alerts
- Alert latency P95: `jq -r '.latency_ms' logs/order_flow/*.jsonl | sort -n | awk '{a[NR]=$1} END {print a[int(NR*0.95)]}'`

**Trade Logs** (`logs/trades.log`):
- Order flow exits: `grep '"exit_reason":"order_flow_alert"' logs/trades.log | wc -l`
- Average P&L: `grep '"exit_reason":"order_flow_alert"' logs/trades.log | jq -r '.exit_pnl' | awk '{sum+=$1; count++} END {print sum/count}'`
- Comparison baseline: `grep '"exit_reason":"stop_loss"' logs/trades.log | jq -r '.exit_pnl' | awk '{sum+=$1; count++} END {print sum/count}'`

**Performance**:
- Memory usage: `ps aux | grep trading_bot | awk '{print $6}'` (before and after feature)
- Latency: Extract from `logs/order_flow/*.jsonl` field `latency_ms`

### Experiment Design (A/B Test)

**Variants**:
- Control: Exit on stop loss only (current behavior)
- Treatment: Exit on order flow alerts + stop loss (new behavior)

**Ramp Plan**:
1. Paper Trading (Days 1-7): Validate alert accuracy, zero false positives tolerance
2. Single Symbol (Days 8-14): Live trading on one symbol, monitor closely
3. Full Watchlist (Days 15+): Apply to all positions if P&L improvement >1%

**Kill Switch**: False positive rate >20% OR alert latency >10 seconds â†’ instant disable

**Sample Size**: 30+ trades per variant (minimum for statistical validity)

## Assumptions

1. **Data Availability** [CLARIFIED]: Robinhood API does NOT support Level 2/Time & Sales data. Using Polygon.io API ($99/month starter plan) as confirmed data source.
2. **Latency Tolerance**: Assumes 2-second alert latency acceptable for day trading use case (sub-second not required).
3. **Position Context** [CLARIFIED]: Order flow monitoring active ONLY during active positions (not continuous watchlist monitoring). Reduces API costs and aligns with risk management focus.
4. **Market Hours**: Assumes order flow detection operates during regular trading hours (7am-10am EST per Constitution).
5. **Exit Authority**: Assumes order flow alerts are recommendations to risk management, not automatic exits (human-in-loop for now).
