# Feature: telegram-notifications

## Overview
Telegram notification system for trading bot alerts and updates.

## Research Findings
[Populated during research phase]

## System Components Analysis
[Populated during system component check]

## Feature Classification
- UI screens: false (backend notification system)
- Improvement: false (new feature addition)
- Measurable: true (notification delivery metrics)
- Deployment impact: true (requires Telegram API credentials)

## Checkpoints
- Phase 0 (Spec): 2025-10-27

## Last Updated
2025-10-27T00:06:00

## Research Findings

### Finding 1: No existing notification system
Source: Grep search across codebase
- No Telegram integration found
- No centralized notification service
- Performance alerts exist (src/trading_bot/performance/alerts.py) but likely console-only
Decision: Build from scratch, integrate with existing alert systems

### Finding 2: Environment variable pattern established
Source: .env.example
- Clear section-based organization (Robinhood, Trading, Logging, Performance, Features)
- Comment-based documentation with security warnings
- Feature-specific sections (Momentum, Emotional Control, Order Flow, Bot API)
Decision: Add TELEGRAM section following existing pattern

### Finding 3: Deployment environment
Source: .env.example, requirements.txt
- Python-based trading bot (robin-stocks, pandas, numpy)
- Direct production deployment (PAPER_TRADING flag for safety)
- No staging environment mentioned
Decision: Deployment impact = true (requires Telegram Bot Token + Chat ID)

### Finding 4: Existing alert system in performance module
Source: Performance tracking section in .env.example
- PERFORMANCE_ALERT_ROLLING_WINDOW configuration
- PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY_TIMEZONE for time-based alerts
Decision: Integrate Telegram notifications with existing alert triggers

### Finding 5: Multi-feature trading bot with real-time monitoring
Source: Codebase structure and .env.example
- Features: Momentum detection, emotional control, order flow monitoring
- Real-time data streams (Alpaca, Polygon)
- Critical timing for day trading (pre-market 4-9:30 AM EST)
Decision: Notification system must support real-time delivery for time-sensitive alerts

### Finding 6: Recent LLM integration (Feature 029)
Source: .env.example BOT_API section, src/trading_bot/llm/
- FastAPI service for bot state access
- LLM-friendly operations
- OpenAI client integration
Decision: Telegram notifications can enhance observability for LLM-driven workflows

## Overview (Final)
Telegram notification system for real-time trading bot alerts. Provides mobile notifications for position entries/exits, risk circuit breakers, system errors, and performance summaries. Non-blocking design ensures trading operations continue regardless of notification delivery status.

## Key Decisions

1. **Non-blocking Architecture**: Notification failures must not prevent trade execution (FR-001)
   - Rationale: Trading operations take priority over observability
   - Implementation: Async delivery with timeout, catch all exceptions

2. **Environment-based Configuration**: TELEGRAM_ENABLED flag with graceful degradation (FR-006)
   - Rationale: Follows existing pattern from .env.example (PAPER_TRADING, EMOTIONAL_CONTROL_ENABLED)
   - Implementation: Check credentials at startup, log warning if missing, continue trading

3. **Rate Limiting for Errors**: Max 1 notification per error type per hour (NFR-004)
   - Rationale: Prevent notification spam during system instability
   - Implementation: In-memory cache of recent error notifications with timestamp

4. **Markdown Formatting**: Default message format with emoji support (FR-008)
   - Rationale: Rich text improves readability on mobile devices
   - Implementation: Telegram parseMode=Markdown, configurable to HTML or None

5. **MVP Scope**: Position notifications + risk alerts only (US1-US3)
   - Rationale: Core value = real-time trade awareness and risk intervention
   - Deferred: Error notifications (US4), performance summaries (US5), momentum signals (US6), bidirectional commands (US7)

## System Components (Not Applicable)
Backend-only feature with no UI components.

## Artifacts Created
- spec.md: Full feature specification (User Stories, Requirements, Success Criteria)
- design/heart-metrics.md: Measurable outcomes (delivery reliability, adoption, retention)
- checklists/requirements.md: Specification quality validation (16/16 checks passed)
- NOTES.md: Research findings and key decisions

## Specification Quality
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all ambiguities resolved with informed guesses)
- 10 functional requirements + 6 non-functional requirements (all testable)
- 8 success criteria (all measurable and technology-agnostic)
- 7 user stories (P1: US1-US3, P2: US4-US5, P3: US6-US7)

## Next Phase
Ready for /plan - specification is complete, validated, and unambiguous.
