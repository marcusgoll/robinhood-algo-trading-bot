# Specification Quality Checklist: telegram-notifications

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Feature**: specs/030-telegram-notificatio/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] CHK001 - No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
  - ✅ Spec describes Telegram notifications as capability, not implementation
  - ✅ References "Telegram Bot API" as dependency but not implementation choice
  - ✅ python-telegram-bot listed in deployment section (appropriate context)

- [x] CHK002 - Focused on user value and business needs
  - ✅ Primary user story emphasizes trader awareness and intervention capability
  - ✅ Success criteria focus on delivery reliability and trader responsiveness

- [x] CHK003 - Written for non-technical stakeholders
  - ✅ User scenarios use plain language (position entry, circuit breaker)
  - ✅ Technical details isolated in Deployment Considerations section

- [x] CHK004 - All mandatory sections completed
  - ✅ User Scenarios, User Stories, Requirements, Success Criteria all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK005 - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (or max 3)
  - ✅ Zero clarification markers (specification is complete)

- [x] CHK006 - Requirements are testable and unambiguous
  - ✅ FR-001: "MUST send Telegram notifications without blocking" - testable via async timeout
  - ✅ FR-003: Specific fields listed for position entry notifications
  - ✅ NFR-001: "latency MUST be <10 seconds (P95)" - measurable threshold

- [x] CHK007 - Success criteria are measurable
  - ✅ SC-001: "within 10 seconds of trade execution" - specific time threshold
  - ✅ SC-004: "99% reliability" - specific percentage target
  - ✅ SC-008: "delivered at configured time" - verifiable behavior

- [x] CHK008 - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
  - ✅ SC-001: "receive position entry notifications on mobile device" (platform-agnostic)
  - ✅ SC-002: "correct P&L calculation" (validated against broker records)
  - ✅ SC-005: "trading operations continue without interruption" (outcome-focused)
  - ✅ No mentions of specific libraries, frameworks, or code patterns

- [x] CHK009 - All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - ✅ 5 primary acceptance scenarios covering all critical notification types
  - ✅ 6 edge cases identified with questions

- [x] CHK010 - Edge cases are identified
  - ✅ Telegram API unavailability, notification failures, missing credentials
  - ✅ Rate limiting, paper vs live mode, message formatting challenges

- [x] CHK011 - Scope is clearly bounded
  - ✅ "Out of Scope" section explicitly lists: multi-user, bidirectional commands, rich media, custom templates, SMS/email
  - ✅ P3 user stories (US6, US7) deferred to post-MVP

- [x] CHK012 - Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - ✅ Dependencies: Telegram Bot API, python-telegram-bot library, existing alert system
  - ✅ Assumptions: Trader has bot token/chat ID, API accessible, Markdown format default

## Feature Readiness

- [x] CHK013 - All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - ✅ FR-001-010 all include specific behaviors or constraints
  - ✅ NFR-001-006 all include measurable thresholds

- [x] CHK014 - User scenarios cover primary flows
  - ✅ Position entry/exit notifications (core trading flow)
  - ✅ Risk alerts (circuit breaker flow)
  - ✅ Error handling and performance summaries (operational flows)

- [x] CHK015 - Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - ✅ HEART metrics align with success criteria
  - ✅ Delivery reliability, trader awareness, adoption all measurable

- [x] CHK016 - No implementation details leak into specification
  - ✅ Spec focuses on "what" (notification capabilities), not "how" (async implementation)
  - ✅ Technical details appropriately isolated in Deployment Considerations

## Notes

**Validation Summary**: All 16 checks passed ✅

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive user stories with clear P1/P2/P3 prioritization
- Well-defined edge cases and assumptions
- Technology-agnostic success criteria (testable without knowing implementation)
- Clear scope boundaries with explicit "Out of Scope" section

**Ready for Planning**: Yes - specification is complete, unambiguous, and testable. No clarifications needed.

**Next Phase**: /plan (ready to proceed with design and technical planning)
