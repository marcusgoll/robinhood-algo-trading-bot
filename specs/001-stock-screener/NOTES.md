# Feature: Stock Screener

## Overview

Stock screener feature for identifying high-probability trading setups by combining technical filters (price, volume, float, daily performance). Addresses roadmap item with score 1.33 (Impact 5, Confidence 0.8, Effort 3).

## Research Findings

### Market Data Module Availability
- âœ… Shipped: market-data-module (v1.0.0) provides real-time quotes, historical data, market hours detection
- âœ… Available: MarketDataService.get_quote(symbol) for bid/ask/volume
- âœ… Available: MarketDataService.get_historical_ohlcv() for 100-day average volume baseline
- âœ… Blocked dependencies: None (market-data-module is shipped and stable)

### Similar Patterns in Codebase
- âœ… Pattern: SafetyChecks module demonstrates multi-criteria validation (buying power, hours, circuit breaker)
- âœ… Pattern: AccountData module shows data aggregation + caching approach (TTL-based)
- âœ… Pattern: TradingLogger shows JSONL audit trail for all trading decisions
- Decision: No new patterns needed; reuse existing safety-check validation and logger patterns

### Reusable Components
- âœ… MarketDataService: Core quote fetching with @with_retry resilience
- âœ… TradingLogger: Structured JSONL logging for all screener queries + results
- âœ… @with_retry decorator: Automatic exponential backoff for Robinhood API rate limiting
- âœ… error-handling-framework: Exception hierarchy (RetriableError, RateLimitError) ready to use
- Decision: No new utilities needed; screener will delegate API calls to MarketDataService

### Performance Targets
- From design/systems/budgets.md: API response times target <200ms P50, <500ms P95
- Trading bot context: Screener runs before/during market hours; 60s+ baseline queries acceptable
- Decision: Target P50 <200ms (single symbol), P95 <500ms (100+ symbol scan); achievable with MarketDataService batch API

### Constitution Compliance Check
- âœ… Â§Safety_First: Screener is tool-only (identifies candidates); no trades executed; paper-trading compatible
- âœ… Â§Code_Quality: Type hints enforced (100% coverage target); KISS principle (simple filters, no ML/ML complexity)
- âœ… Â§Risk_Management: Screener is passive (no position changes); traders apply own risk rules to results
- âœ… Â§Testing_Requirements: 90% test coverage target; backtesting possible (historical filter simulation)
- âœ… Â§Audit_Everything: All screener queries logged to JSONL with params, results, latency

## Feature Classification

- **UI screens**: false (backend API feature only)
- **Improvement**: false (new feature, not optimizing existing flow)
- **Measurable outcomes**: true (track screener usage, setup success rate, false positive rate)
- **Deployment impact**: false (no migrations, no env vars, no platform changes)

## System Components Analysis

**Reusable (from existing codebase)**:
- MarketDataService (quote retrieval, retry logic)
- TradingLogger (JSONL audit trail)
- @with_retry decorator (exponential backoff)
- error-handling-framework (exception types)

**New Components Needed**:
- ScreenerService class (orchestrates filters, returns typed results)
- ScreenerQuery dataclass (filter parameters with validation)
- ScreenerResult dataclass (results + metadata)

**Rationale**: System-first approach; reuse proven resilience patterns from market-data-module and error-handling-framework to ensure screener is reliable under API rate limiting.

## Deployment Model

Project type: `local-only` (no remote staging/production deployment)

Implications:
- No staging environment validation required
- No A/B test infrastructure needed
- Deploy to local trading environment only
- Manual backtest validation sufficient (no Vercel/Railway deployment)
- Feature ready for production once 90% coverage reached
