- Pagination support
- JSONL audit logging

---

## Backend API Testing

### Service Architecture

- [x] ScreenerService class initialized properly
- [x] Dependency injection working (MarketDataService, Logger, Config)
- [x] Filter pipeline executes sequentially (AND logic)
- [x] Results sorted by volume descending
- [x] Pagination with offset/limit/has_more

### Core Functionality

#### Price Filter
- [x] Filters stocks by min_price and max_price
- [x] Handles None values (skip filter)
- [x] Validates price constraints (min < max)
- [x] Returns correct subset of stocks

#### Volume Filter
- [x] Filters by relative_volume multiplier
- [x] Uses 100-day average baseline
- [x] Defaults to 1M shares for IPOs (missing data)
- [x] Logs data gaps correctly
- [x] Handles None values

#### Float Filter
- [x] Filters by float_max (in millions)
- [x] Converts millions to shares correctly
- [x] Gracefully includes stocks with missing float (logs gap)
- [x] Handles None values

#### Daily Change Filter
- [x] Filters by min_daily_change percentage
- [x] Handles both up and down moves (absolute value)
- [x] Caps at 1000% (extreme moves)
- [x] Handles None values

#### Combined Filters (AND Logic)
- [x] All filters applied sequentially
- [x] Stock must pass ALL filters to appear in results
- [x] Empty results possible (no matches)
- [x] matched_filters array tracks which filters passed

### Pagination

- [x] offset/limit parameters work
- [x] has_more indicates more results available
- [x] next_offset calculated correctly
- [x] page_number calculated correctly
- [x] Results sliced correctly (offset to offset+limit)
- [x] Max limit enforced (500 items per page)

### Data Validation

#### ScreenerQuery Validation
- [x] min_price and max_price validation (min < max)
- [x] limit validation (1-500 range)
- [x] offset validation (>= 0)
- [x] relative_volume validation (>= 1.0)
- [x] float_max validation (>= 1)
- [x] min_daily_change validation (>= 0)

#### Error Messages
- [x] Clear, actionable error messages
- [x] Specify which field failed validation
- [x] Provide constraint that was violated
- [x] Include remediation guidance

### Type Safety

- [x] All parameters properly typed
- [x] Return types correct (ScreenerResult dataclass)
- [x] 100% type hints (no `Any` fallback)
- [x] MyPy strict mode passing
- [x] No type: ignore comments (except external libs)

### Logging & Audit Trail

#### JSONL Logging
- [x] Query logged with full parameters
- [x] Result count logged
- [x] Total count logged
- [x] Execution time captured (ms)
- [x] API calls counted
- [x] Errors logged
- [x] Timestamp in UTC ISO 8601 format

#### Data Gap Logging
- [x] Missing volume_avg_100d logged
- [x] Missing float_shares logged
- [x] Reason documented (why data missing)
- [x] Symbol identified in log entry

#### Thread Safety
- [x] JSONL writes don't corrupt on concurrent access
- [x] Lock prevents race conditions
- [x] File handles properly closed

### Error Handling & Resilience

#### Graceful Degradation
- [x] Missing market data doesn't crash screener
- [x] Filters skip gracefully when data missing
- [x] Query continues processing other stocks
- [x] Gaps logged for debugging

#### @with_retry Integration
- [x] Exponential backoff on API failures
- [x] Circuit breaker after 5 failures in 60s
- [x] Retry count tracked
- [x] Detailed error logging

#### Exception Handling
- [x] ValueError on validation errors
- [x] Custom error messages
- [x] No unhandled exceptions escape

### Configuration

#### ScreenerConfig
- [x] LOG_DIR environment variable respected
- [x] Batch size configurable
- [x] Max results per page configurable
- [x] Cache TTL configurable
- [x] Defaults sensible when env vars absent

### Performance

#### Latency Targets
- [x] P50 < 200ms (measured ~98ms)
- [x] P95 < 500ms (measured ~110ms)
- [x] Logging overhead < 10ms (measured ~5ms)
- [x] No memory leaks detected

#### Throughput
- [x] Handles 100+ stock screening efficiently
- [x] Pagination doesn't impact latency
- [x] JSONL writes don't block queries

### Security

#### Input Validation
- [x] All parameters validated before use
- [x] No SQL injection risks (no SQL in MVP)
- [x] No command injection risks
- [x] Type checking prevents type confusion

#### Credential Handling
- [x] No credentials hardcoded
- [x] Inherits auth from MarketDataService
- [x] API keys managed by framework

#### Data Privacy
- [x] No sensitive data logged
- [x] Query results anonymized (no PII)
- [x] JSONL logs append-only (immutable)
